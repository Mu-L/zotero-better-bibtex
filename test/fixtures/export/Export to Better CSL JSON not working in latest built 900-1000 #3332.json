Two broad categories of fragmentation pat- terns among metalwork assemblages from Bronze Age hoard contexts can be established, one stemming from the ritual decommissioning of items for eminently religious purposes, the other from the breaking-up of metal objects for recycling or for use within the context of a weight-based hack- bronze currency. This dichotomy does not always map neatly onto the dis- tinction between the religious and the mundane where the motives behind the subsequent deposition of fragmented metalwork are concerned.","title":"Überlegungen zur intentionellen Beschädigung und Fragmentierung von Hortbronzen","creators":[{"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Brandherm","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Przybyła","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Karol","lastName":"Dzięgielewski","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Fragmentierung"},{"tag":"Prämonetäre Systeme"},{"tag":"Maßsysteme"},{"tag":"Gewichtssystem"}],"dateAdded":"2023-12-21T08:30:03Z","dateModified":"2023-12-21T08:33:42Z","itemID":31710,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Brandherm2019UberlegungenZur","publicationTitle":"Chasing Bronze Age rainbows.

In most societies the disposal of the corpse is accompanied by some form of celebration or ritual which may range from a simple act of deportment in solitude to the engagement of large masses of people in laborious and creative festivities. In a funerary context the term ritual may be taken to represent a process that incorporates all the actions performed and thoughts expressed in connection with a dying and dead person, from the preparatory pre-death stages to the final deposition of the corpse and the post-mortem stages of grief and commemoration. The contributions presented here are focused not on the examination of different funerary practices, their function and meaning, but on the changes of such rituals – how and when they occurred and how they may be explained. Based on case studies from a range of geographical regions and from different prehistoric and historical periods, a range of key themes are examined concerning belief and ritual, body and deposition, place, performance and commemoration, exploring a complex web of practices.","title":"Death and Changing Rituals: Function and meaning in ancient funerary practices","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

Here, we used a combination of stable isotope analyses and three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to test for differences in, and associations between, diet and mandibular morphology based on 150 dogs of three sites of the Chalcolithic Gumelniţa culture in Romania (4550–3900 cal. BCE) characterized by different socio-economic systems. At Hârşova-tell and Borduşani-Popină, where the subsistence economy is mainly based on herding, dogs have a variable diet that is rich in domestic animals (sheep, cattle, pig) and may contain fish. In contrast, at Vităneşti-Măgurice, where hunting predominates, the diet of dogs is more specialized towards large game (red deer, aurochs, wild horse), reflecting the composition of human food refuse. Moreover, dogs have more robust (but not larger) mandibles at this site with shapes suggesting a greater importance of the temporal muscle important for the capture of large prey and the breaking of large bones. The strong covariation between mandible shape and stable isotope signatures suggests functional adaptations to diet. Overall, our results support the idea that prehistoric dogs adapted to human lifestyles.","title":"Morphological and dietary adaptations to different socio-economic systems in Chalcolithic dogs","creators":[{"firstName":"Colline","lastName":"Brassard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Balasse","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bălăşescu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Radu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Morgane","lastName":"Ollivier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Fiorillo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Herrel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stéphanie","lastName":"Bréhard","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Rumänien"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Hund"}],"dateAdded":"2023-08-28T08:08:15Z","dateModified":"2023-08-28T08:08:15Z","itemID":31271,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrassardEtAl2023MorphologicalDietary"},{"key":"JK9GHNFB","version":4193,"itemType":"book","series":"Baltic-Pontic Studies 12","place":"Poznań","publisher":"Adam Mickiewicz Univ","date":"2003","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3048","title":"The foundations of radiocarbon chronology of cultures between the Vistula and Dnieper 4000-1000 BC","creators":[{"firstName":"Stanislav N.","lastName":"Bratchenko","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:39:41Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:39:41Z","itemID":4301,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Bratchenko2003FoundationsRadiocarbon"},{"key":"8R6YPDSA","version":2157,"itemType":"book","series":"Ergänzungsbde. zum Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskde.","place":"Berlin - New York","date":"2008","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5343","seriesNumber":"61","title":"Archäologie der westlichen Slawen.

We demonstrate that the development of a new type of settlement, the tell site, which in southeastern Romania fully began with the Gumelniţa culture, was accompanied by changes in the meat component of the diet. The 39 available faunal spectra are processed by correspondence analyses; this shows that the homogeneity that characterized the previous cultures (Hamangia and Boian) was followed by a greater diversity in animal exploitation systems in the Gumelniţa culture. The main change is the important role that large game played for some Gumelniţa communities (the favored species varied). However, variability existed within the domestic species as well. This may result from the interaction between several possible factors (e.g. new husbandry techniques, complex socio-economic relations between the sites, a great social value given to wild mammals). This diversity contrasts with the homogeneity of the pastoral practices developed for sheep (and, to a lesser extent, for cattle) at the Gumelniţa tell sites (reliable kill-off patterns were established for five sites). We also show that sheep exploitation was specialized. Given that this kind of specialized exploitation became the norm from the Gumelniţa period, we propose that the appearance of homogeneous and specialized practices for sheep is linked to the development of tell sites. More generally, certain standardization in pastoral practices during the Gumelniţa period is possible. For three tell sites, it is likely that the youngest sheep and goats died mainly elsewhere; we suggest that these settlements were parts of larger pastoral systems, on a local or regional scale, and that places or sites with complementary functions existed.","title":"What's behind the tell phenomenon?

In the middle valley of the Rhône, comparison of the pastoral practices specific to cattle and to sheep and goats, in relation to cave as well as open-air occupations, enables definition of the relations that existed between the sites during the late phase of the Chassean culture. It is demonstrated that the different stages of the annual pastoral cycle were distributed among several sites, whether for sheep and goats or for cattle, and that the large open-air sites had distinct functions according to the species exploited. The discovery of a specialization of places and of practices (general for the caves, partial for the large open-air sites) then leads us to propose the existence of a specialization of individuals or at least small groups (shepherds and cattle herdsmen) as of the beginning of the fourth millennium BC in this region. These elements suggest that population movements of different kinds occurred in the Chassean period in the middle Rhône Valley.","title":"Shepherds, cowherds and site function on middle Neolithic sites of the Rhône valley: An archaeozoological approach to the organization of territories and societies","creators":[{"firstName":"Stéphanie","lastName":"Bréhard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alain","lastName":"Beeching","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean-Denis","lastName":"Vigne","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Spezialisierung"},{"tag":"Sozialarchäologie"},{"tag":"Chasseen"},{"tag":"Pastoralismus"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:11Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:45:11Z","itemID":5634,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrehardEtAl2010ShepherdsCowherds"},{"key":"HDD65C52","version":1733,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Arch.

These, dated from the Early Neolithic (from 5450 cal. BCE onwards) to the Late Bronze Age (1300–750 cal. BCE; youngest sample ca. 1000 BCE), include vessels from the Linear Pottery (LBK), Schiepzig/Schöningen groups (SCHIP), Baalberge (BAC), Corded Ware (CWC), Bell Beaker (BBC), and Únětice (UC) archaeological cultures. Organic residue analyses performed on this assemblage determined the presence of vessel contents surviving as lipid residues in 109 cases. These were studied in relation to the changing use of settlement and funerary pottery types and, in the case of burials, to the funerary contexts in which the vessels had been placed. The obtained results confirmed a marked increase in the consumption of dairy products linked to innovations in pottery types (e.g., small cups) during the Funnel Beaker related Baalberge Culture of the 4th millennium BCE. Although the intensive use of dairy products may have continued into the 3rd millennium BCE, especially amongst Bell Beaker populations, Corded Ware vessels found in funerary contexts suggest an increase in the importance of non-ruminant products, which may be linked to the production of specific vessel shapes and decoration. In the Early Bronze Age circum-Harz Únětice group (ca. 2200–1550 BCE), which saw the emergence of a highly hierarchical society, a greater variety of animal and plant derived products was detected in a much more standardised but, surprisingly, more multifunctional pottery assemblage. This long-term study of lipid residues from a concise region in Central Europe thus reveals the complex relationships that prehistoric populations established between food resources and the main means to prepare, store, and consume them.","title":"Pottery spilled the beans: Patterns in the processing and consumption of dietary lipids in Central Germany from the Early Neolithic to the Bronze Age","shortTitle":"Pottery spilled the beans","creators":[{"firstName":"Adrià","lastName":"Breu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Risch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Molina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Friederich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Franziska","lastName":"Knoll","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Linienbandkeramik"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Lipidanalyse"},{"tag":"Rückstandsanalyse"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Mitteldeutschland"},{"tag":"Sachsen-Anhalt"},{"tag":"Baalberger Kultur"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Schöninger Gruppe"}],"dateAdded":"2024-05-27T11:38:15Z","dateModified":"2024-05-27T11:40:41Z","itemID":32277,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BreuEtAl2024PotterySpilled"},{"key":"XP8I8THM","version":3655,"itemType":"book","place":"Köln","date":"1987","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1767","title":"14C-Chronologie des vorderasiatischen, südost- und mitteleuropäischen Neolithikums.

However, ancient writings, ethnographic studies and the evidence of archaeological exploitation highlight it as an essential reference for humanity. Both an edible product and a crucial element for food preservation, it has been used by the first human settlements as soon as food storage appeared (Neolithic).\n\nAs far as the history of food habits (both nutrition and preservation) is concerned, the identification and the use of that resource certainly proves a revolution as meaningful as the domestication of plants and wild animals. On a global scale, the development of new economic forms based on the management of food surplus went along an increased use of saline resources through a specific technical knowledge, aimed at the extraction of salt from its natural supports.\n\nConsidering the variety of former practices observed until now, a pluralist approach based on human as well as environmental sciences is required. It allows a better knowledge of the historical interactions between our societies and this “white gold”, which are well-known from the Middle-Ages, but more hypothetical for earlier times.\n\nThis publication intends to present the most recent progresses in the field of salt archaeology in Europe and beyond; it also exposes various approaches allowing a thorough understanding of this complex and many-faceted subject. The complementary themes dealt with in this book, the broad chronological and geographical focus, as well as the relevance of the results presented, make this contribution a key synthesis of the most recent research on this universal topic.","title":"Archaeology of Salt.

In this work, two different structures were built and monitored. They aimed at reproducing two types of archaeological hearth morphology encountered at the Bronze Age site of the cave of Les Fraux (Saint Martin de Fressengeas, Dordogne, France). A series of fires was constructed and a large amount of data was collected: temperature curves, wood consumption and observations on substratum evolution. A numerical code for heat transfer was developed to model heat propagation from the surface to the underlying sedimentary layers, the input parameters of which were adapted to fit the thermal evolution observed with the experimental fires. We found that two archaeological parameters are fundamental to characterise the intensity of the fire: the paleotemperature reached at the surface of the burnt sediment (which in our case was determined by thermoluminescence analyses) and the depth of the rubefaction front as an indicator of a 250 °C isothermal surface. We then estimated the duration of an equivalent single fire that would correspond to one of the archaeological hearths investigated. Finally, with the wood consumption recorded during the fire experiments, and the estimated firing duration, the energy involved was evaluated. When generalised to the study of archaeological hearths, this approach could be of great interest in firing intensity evaluation (temperature/time/energy).","title":"A new process of reconstructing archaeological fires from their impact on sediment: a coupled experimental and numerical approach based on the case study of hearths from the cave of Les Fraux (Dordogne, France)","creators":[{"firstName":"Aurélie","lastName":"Brodard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Delphine","lastName":"Lacanette-Puyo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Guibert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"François","lastName":"Lévêque","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Albane","lastName":"Burens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Carozza","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Höhle"},{"tag":"Experimentelle Archäologie"},{"tag":"Feuer"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:00:06Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:00:06Z","itemID":9684,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrodardEtAl2016NewProcess"},{"key":"LULMQKYN","version":4319,"itemType":"book","date":"1960","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1771","title":"Steinzeit in Dänemark.

Shorter records provide similar information in many archaeological contexts. However if such records are to be used to provide precise timing of events, and more critically the relative timing between different records, methods are needed to provide accurate and precise age–depth models for these sequences. Given the imprecision of individual calibrated radiocarbon determinations it is necessary to use the information we have about the deposition process to refine our chronologies and also to provide interpolation between dated levels in any sequence. Even with layer counted chronologies, the uncertainties are sometimes hard to quantify. This paper outlines a range of Bayesian models for deposition which have been implemented in the computer programme OxCal. These models can be used to combine information from the sediments themselves with radiocarbon or other direct dating information. Such models have the potential to integrate information between different records and provide a coherent chronology on which to base environmental or archaeological research.","title":"Deposition models for chronological records","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Bronk Ramsey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bayesische Statistik"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:50:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:50:00Z","itemID":7147,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BronkRamsey2008DepositionModels"},{"key":"NAJMN8AM","version":4036,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"50","issue":"2","pages":"249-275","publicationTitle":"Archaeometry","ISSN":"1475-4754","date":"2008","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5800","DOI":"10.1111/j.1475-4754.2008.00394.x","abstractNote":"Radiocarbon dating has undergone a number of ‘revolutions’ in the past 50 years. This is in part because it is a field in continuous development, but perhaps more because of its profound impact on archaeology and the nature of interdisciplinary research. In order to understand the use of radiocarbon as a dating tool, it is necessary to understand the life cycle of radiocarbon, from its production in the upper atmosphere, through its sequestration in reservoirs and samples and its final decay. Different elements in this life cycle lead to complications, or subtleties that need to be understood if we wish to develop high-resolution chronologies. Most of the changes that have influenced radiocarbon dating are revolutions in understanding of the natural world in disparate academic disciplines. More than ever, it is necessary for users of radiocarbon to understand and engage with the science that underlies the method.","title":"RADIOCARBON DATING: REVOLUTIONS IN UNDERSTANDING*","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Bronk Ramsey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:59Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:52:59Z","itemID":8262,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BronkRamsey2008RADIOCARBONDATING"},{"key":"PUJLDT4B","version":24435,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"51","issue":"1","pages":"337-360","publicationTitle":"Radiocarbon","date":"2009","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5137","DOI":"10.1017/S0033822200033865","abstractNote":"If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the 14C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of 14C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many 14C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used \"uniform phase\" models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind.","title":"Bayesian Analysis of Radiocarbon Dates","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Bronk Ramsey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bayesische Statistik"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:50:01Z","dateModified":"2024-04-24T18:55:18Z","itemID":7150,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BronkRamsey2009BayesianAnalysis"},{"key":"6NXW5IVY","version":3967,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"59","issue":"6","pages":"1809-1833","publicationTitle":"Radiocarbon","date":"2017","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6867","abstractNote":"NACHTRAGEN","title":"Methods for Summarizing Radiocarbon Datasets","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Bronk Ramsey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bayesische Statistik"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:04:07Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:04:07Z","itemID":10312,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BronkRamsey2017MethodsSummarizing"},{"key":"8I3QB3GP","version":4038,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"56","issue":"2","pages":"789-799","publicationTitle":"Radiocarbon","date":"10/16/ 2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6041","abstractNote":"Dietary offsets in radiocarbon dates are becoming increasingly interesting to researchers, not only because of their impact on the reliability of chronologies but also because of the possibilities for extracting further dietary information from the 14 C data itself.  This is the case with the cemeteries of the Cis-Baikal region being studied as part of the international Baikal-Hokkaido Archaeology Project set up to examine hunter-gatherer cultural dynamics in eastern Asia. Fortunately, to control for a freshwater reservoir offset, we were able to obtain a number of paired terrestrial herbivore and human material for 14 C dating.  This article tests the correspondence between stable isotope evidence and the offsets seen in 14 C values and the implications for the analysis of the 14 C measurements as “chronometric dates.”  This is an unusually well documented example of freshwater reservoir offsets, providing an ideal case study to test different approaches to analysing such offset information.  Here, we compare a purely Bayesian approach with the more frequently applied linear regression analysis.

The results date their construction to the Early to Middle Bronze Age, when they were built by cutting back the hillside, stone clearance and wall construction. Environmental evidence points to their use for cereal cultivation. The authors suggest that the construction and use of these terraces formed part of an Early to Middle Bronze Age agricultural intensification, which may have been both demographically and culturally driven.","title":"Early to Middle Bronze Age agricultural terraces in north-east England: morphology, dating and cultural implications","shortTitle":"Early to Middle Bronze Age agricultural terraces in north-east England","creators":[{"firstName":"Antony G.","lastName":"Brown","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Fallu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Cucchiaro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monica","lastName":"Alonso-Eguiluz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rosa Maria","lastName":"Albert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Walsh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ben R.","lastName":"Pears","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Scaife","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Langdon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Tarolli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cockroft","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lisa","lastName":"Snape","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Lang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Philippa","lastName":"Ascough","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pengzhi","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristof Van","lastName":"Oost","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clive","lastName":"Waddington","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Landflursystem"},{"tag":"OSL-Datierung"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Landnutzung"},{"tag":"Geoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Schottland"},{"tag":"Phytolithenanalyse"},{"tag":"Pollenanalyse"},{"tag":"Agrarlandschaft"}],"dateAdded":"2023-03-06T13:18:59Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:51:56Z","itemID":31013,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrownEtAl2023EarlyMiddle"},{"key":"BWDTVXLQ","version":22432,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119592112.ch30","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","pages":"613-627","ISBN":"978-1-119-59211-2","date":"2023","extra":"Section: 30\n_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119592112.ch30\nDOI: 10.1002/9781119592112.ch30","accessDate":"2023-12-15T11:10:48Z","libraryCatalog":"Wiley Online Library","language":"en","abstractNote":"The last decade has seen major advances in the study of ancient DNA from humans and other species, driven by the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques and the discovery that the densely packed bone of the petrous otic capsule provides a favourable environment for DNA preservation.

The traditional method of sexing human skeletal remains makes use of dimorphic bone morphology allied with morphometric data obtained from reference collections of modern or recent human populations.

Following the peak of megalithic construction by the Funnel Beaker societies and preceding new building activities by the Corded Ware societies, this period can be referred as the ‘Dark Ages’ of the north. Our analysis of this period within the context of a German Research Foundation Collaborative Research Centre (CRC 1266) project resulted in a new perspective on the role of settlement patterns associated with a ceramic type known as Store Valby. In addition to small domestic sites, such as Schönhagen LA 107 (Brodersby), which dominate on the western and southern parts of the Cimbrian peninsula, research has identified giant settlements to the west, from around 2900 BCE, and palisade enclosures to the east. Despite the diversity of regional developments in the western Baltic, we think that the general characterisation of these centuries as an independent phase of socio-environmental transformations can serve as a model for the entire region.","title":"The Dark Ages in the North?

This region is characterised by extensive wetlands on the southern border of the Northern Lowland and has been subject of several research projects on Mesolithic and Neolithic sites since the last century. Archaeological prospections in the 1940s led to the detection of a domestic site of the BB groups at the Hunte 4 site. In 2020, new research was carried out at this site, which, through the integration of archaeology, geophysics and palynology, identified a Late SG and BB site and reconstructed the surrounding landscape. In contrast to the Hunte 1 settlement with building structures 2.5 km to the south, which also shows SG and BB activities, the results of the investigations at Hunte 4 point to a temporary use of the site. Consequently, a settlement system can be reconstructed in the region of the Dümmer for the second half of the third millennium and at the beginning of the second millennium BCE, which consisted of at least one permanent settlement and at the minimum one temporarily used sites – several more could be presumed but have to yet be localised. At the same time, the Dümmer region marks the southern border of a settlement system in the central Northern European Plain which is characterised by less domestic site, less permanent settlement sites and buildings structures. This contrasts with the increasing number of known settlement sites in the surrounding regions of the central Northern European Plain and suggests a higher translocality of individuals and groups in this area.","title":"Hunte 4: Re-validation of a Bell Beaker domestic site in the Dümmer region in northwestern Germany","shortTitle":"Hunte 4","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan Piet","lastName":"Brozio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Feeser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Heumüller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erica","lastName":"Corradini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wiebke","lastName":"Kirleis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Dörfler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ercan","lastName":"Erkul","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tina","lastName":"Wunderlich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Norddeutschland"},{"tag":"Palynologie"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Siedlungsmodell"},{"tag":"Feuchtbodensiedlung"},{"tag":"Einzelgrabkultur"},{"tag":"Schleswig-Holstein"},{"tag":"Siedlungsprozesse"}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-01T07:36:51Z","dateModified":"2024-09-12T15:39:26Z","itemID":32300,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrozioEtAl2023HunteRevalidation"},{"key":"L32TVD9T","version":19442,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283007","volume":"18","issue":"5","pages":"e0283007","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"10 May 2023","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0283007","accessDate":"2023-05-17T05:45:14Z","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","abstractNote":"The production, distribution and use of copper objects and the development of metallurgical skills in Neolithic Northern Central Europe and Southern Scandinavia are linked to early centres of copper metallurgy of South East Central Europe and Southeast Europe. A total of 45 Neolithic copper objects, until now the largest sample of Early Neolithic objects from the Northern Central European Plain and Southern Scandinavia, were selected for new lead isotope analyses. They aided in the identification of the origin of the copper: These new analyses indicate that the copper ore deposits in Southeastern Europe, especially from the Serbian mining areas, were used for the Early Neolithic northern artefacts (ca. 4100–3300 BC). The most likely sources of copper for the few Middle Neolithic artefacts (ca. 3300–2800 BC) seem to be from the Slovak Ore Mountains, the Serbian mining areas and the Eastern Alps, whereas deposits of the Slovak Ore Mountains and the Alpine region were used for the Late Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age (ca. 2300–1700 BC) artefacts. For the artefacts dated after 2000 BC, the Great Orme mine in Wales also appears to have been the source of copper for the analysed metals. The use of copper from different regions of Europe probably reflects changing social and cultural connectivities on a European scale and the changing chronology of copper exploitation.","title":"The origin of Neolithic copper on the central Northern European plain and in Southern Scandinavia: Connectivities on a European scale","shortTitle":"The origin of Neolithic copper on the central Northern European plain and in Southern Scandinavia","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan Piet","lastName":"Brozio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zofia","lastName":"Stos-Gale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Müller-Scheeßel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Schultrich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Fritsch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fritz","lastName":"Jürgens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Skorna","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Norddeutschland"},{"tag":"Metallanalyse"},{"tag":"Rohstoffquellen"},{"tag":"Nordische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"},{"tag":"Rohmaterialvorkommen"},{"tag":"Bleiisotopie"},{"tag":"Neolithic period","type":1},{"tag":"Europe","type":1},{"tag":"Chemical deposition","type":1},{"tag":"Copper","type":1},{"tag":"Isotopes","type":1},{"tag":"Metallic lead","type":1},{"tag":"Metallurgy","type":1},{"tag":"Raw materials","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2023-05-17T05:45:14Z","dateModified":"2023-05-17T05:45:14Z","itemID":31054,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrozioEtAl2023OriginNeolithic"},{"key":"K3VYDJXT","version":2159,"itemType":"book","series":"Beitr. zur Arch. in Niedersachsen","place":"Rahden/Westf.","publisher":"Leidorf","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5365","seriesNumber":"17","title":"Zwei Studien zu den neolithischen und bronzezeitlichen Grabanlagen der Lüneburger Heide","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan Piet","lastName":"Brozio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Franziska","lastName":"Hage","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Norddeutschland"},{"tag":"Niedersachsen"},{"tag":"Hügelgrab"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:05Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:51:05Z","itemID":7517,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrozioHage2013ZweiStudien"},{"key":"YXN529ZV","version":11396,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"80","pages":"122-161","publicationTitle":"Ber.

This article draws on anthropological research to argue that kinship relations are not determined by biogenetic links, but are generated through social practice. A variety of archaeological evidence can be employed to explore how enduring affective relationships are created with both human and non-human others. These points require us to challenge androcentric and heteronormative interpretations of aDNA data in the Bronze Age and more widely.","title":"Ancient DNA, kinship and relational identities in Bronze Age Britain","creators":[{"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Brück","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Verwandschaft"},{"tag":"Kinship"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-09-09T13:23:03Z","dateModified":"2023-07-28T08:31:16Z","itemID":11709,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Bruck2021AncientDNA"},{"key":"W2IMA7CA","version":24922,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/power-of-relics-the-curation-of-human-bone-in-british-bronze-age-burials/54F72F3A23123CE92393929753F6765D","pages":"1-23","publicationTitle":"European Journal of Archaeology","ISSN":"1461-9571, 1741-2722","date":"2022/05/25","DOI":"10.1017/eaa.2022.18","accessDate":"2022-06-07T07:39:18Z","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge University Press","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this article, the authors examine radiocarbon, histo-taphonomic, and contextual evidence for the deliberate curation, manipulation, and redeposition of human bone in British Bronze Age mortuary contexts.

It has the general goal to establish the tin isotopic composition of tin ores and tin-bearing artefacts, and considers the infl uence of anthropogenic processes on the isotope ratios. We discuss the tin isotopic composition of cassiterite from two major tin provinces in Europe: from Cornwall and Devon (Southern England), and from the Erzgebirge (Germany and Czech Republic). The samples from both tin provinces show a very large variation of isotopic compositions with δ124/120Sn-values ranging overall from -0.28 to 0.85‰. Although there is large overlap, on average, cassiterite from the Erzgebirge (δ124/120Sn = 0.09‰) is isotopically lighter than that of southwest England (δ124/120Sn = 0.18‰). This is due to a higher proportion of heavy isotope compositions in the samples from Cornwall and Devon. In addition, we compare the ore data with preliminary tin isotopic systematics in Early Bronze Age metal artefacts from the Únětice Culture in Central Germany and from several ancient settlements in Mesopotamia belonging to the Early Dynastic III and the Akkadian Periods. Bronze artefacts of the Únětice Culture containing more than 3 wt.% tin have rather constant isotopic compositions (δ124/120Sn = 0.2 to 0.31 ‰), despite having highly variable trace element concentrations and tin contents. This suggests the intentional addition of an isotopically homogeneous tin raw material (metal or cassiterite) to the copper ore or melt. In contrast, the tin isotopic composition of artefacts from Mesopotamia (>3 wt. % Sn) show a much larger δ124/120Sn variation from -0.2 to +0.4‰. This is even observed in single settlements such as Ur. Since there is no sizeable tin mineralization in the vicinity, this implies that the tin demand of the ancient metallurgist was covered by trading tin from different ore sources.","title":"Tin isotope fingerprints of ore deposits and ancient bronze","shortTitle":"The tinworking landscape of Dartmoor in a European context - prehistory to 20th century","creators":[{"firstName":"Phil","lastName":"Newman","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Brügmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Berger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carolin","lastName":"Frank","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Janeta","lastName":"Marahrens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bianka","lastName":"Nessel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Rohmaterialvorkommen"},{"tag":"Zinnisotopie"},{"tag":"Zinn"}],"dateAdded":"2023-01-03T09:31:08Z","dateModified":"2023-01-03T09:55:56Z","itemID":27324,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrugmannEtAl2017TinIsotope","publicationTitle":"The tinworking landscape of Dartmoor in a European context - prehistory to 20th century: papers presented at a conference in Tavistock, Devon, 6-11 May 2016 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the DTRG"},{"key":"HC4WBF8T","version":4319,"itemType":"book","place":"Novi Sad","date":"1974","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1775","title":"Praistorija Vojvodine.

Bringing to light the social relations of earlier time periods, archaeology plays a critical role in documenting the full range of human variation, a role that cannot be filled by ethnography, history, or ethnohistory with their shorter temporal spans. By questioning essentialist notions of binary gender systems, gender research in archaeology can lead to a reevaluation of long-standing disciplinary assumptions about the nature of household organization, subsistence and craft production, ritual performance, and the structure of ancient states. The materiality of gender relations and gender identities in the archaeological record allows archaeologists to conduct historical comparisons of ancient, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic time periods to document changes as well as continuities in human social conditions. In so doing, archaeologists are able to expose ancient social scenarios that are distinctive from contemporary arrangements and thus widen the scope of the social sciences.","title":"1 Gender, Households, and Society: An Introduction","creators":[{"firstName":"Elizabeth M.","lastName":"Brumfiel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Robin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Ethnografie"},{"tag":"Gender"},{"tag":"Ethnoarchäologie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:50:07Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:50:07Z","itemID":7207,"notes":[],"citationKey":"BrumfielRobin2008GenderHouseholds"},{"key":"D6RHK5KC","version":24423,"itemType":"book","series":"Berliner Archäologische Forschungen","place":"Rahden/Westf.","publisher":"Verlag Marie Leidorf GmbH","ISBN":"978-3-89646-527-6","date":"2018","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7440","seriesNumber":"17","title":"Frühe Eisenverhüttung bei Glienick","creators":[{"firstName":"Markolf","lastName":"Brumlich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Brandenburg"},{"tag":"Eisenmetallurgie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:45Z","dateModified":"2024-04-24T18:34:32Z","itemID":11345,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Brumlich2018FruheEisenverhuttung"},{"key":"M7CHZT7K","version":24418,"itemType":"book","series":"Berliner Archäologische Forschungen","place":"Rahden/Westf.","publisher":"VML Vlg Marie Leidorf","ISBN":"978-3-89646-528-3","date":"2020-08","callNumber":"930.1","seriesNumber":"18","libraryCatalog":"BnF ISBN","language":"eng","title":"The coming of iron: The Beginnings of Iron Smelting in Central Europe.

This panel provides a high-resolution transect of the dynamics of maternal and paternal lineages in France as well as of autosomal genotypes. Parental lineages and genomic data both revealed demographic patterns in France for the Neolithic and Bronze Age transitions consistent with neighboring regions, first with a migration wave of Anatolian farmers followed by varying degrees of admixture with autochthonous hunter-gatherers, and then substantial gene flow from individuals deriving part of their ancestry from the Pontic steppe at the onset of the Bronze Age. Our data have also highlighted the persistence of Magdalenian-associated ancestry in hunter-gatherer populations outside of Spain and thus provide arguments for an expansion of these populations at the end of the Paleolithic Period more northerly than what has been described so far. Finally, no major demographic changes were detected during the transition between the Bronze and Iron Ages.","title":"Ancient genomes from present-day France unveil 7,000 years of its demographic history","creators":[{"firstName":"Samantha","lastName":"Brunel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E.
