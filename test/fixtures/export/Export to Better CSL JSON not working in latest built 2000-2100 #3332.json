This evidence is critical for understanding the motivations for violence and its effects on opposing and competing individuals and groups across time and space. Selecting the Neolithic of northwestern Europe as an area for study, the present paper examines the variation and societal context for the violence recorded in the human skeletal remains from this region as one of the most important elements of human welfare. Compiling data from various sources, it becomes apparent that violence was endemic in Neolithic Europe, sometimes reaching levels of intergroup hostilities that ended in the utter destruction of entire communities. While the precise comparative quantification of healed and unhealed trauma remains a fundamental problem, patterns emerge that see conflict likely fostered by increasing competition between settled and growing communities, e.g., for access to arable land for food production. The further development of contextual information is paramount in order to address hypotheses on the motivations, origins, and evolution of violence as based on the study of human remains, the most direct indicator for actual small- and large-scale violence.","title":"Conflict, violence, and warfare among early farmers in Northwestern Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Fibiger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Torbjörn","lastName":"Ahlström","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Meyer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Smith","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Spätneolithikum"},{"tag":"Trauma"},{"tag":"Gewalt"},{"tag":"Überblick"}],"dateAdded":"2023-01-20T07:05:22Z","dateModified":"2023-01-20T09:54:17Z","itemID":27497,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FibigerEtAl2023ConflictViolence"},{"key":"MVB3QFMP","version":15128,"itemType":"book","series":"Veröffentlichungen des Staatlichen Amtes für Denkmalpflege Stuttgart","volume":"7","place":"Stuttgart","publisher":"Verlag Silberburg","date":"1962","seriesNumber":"A","title":"Katalog Kirchheim unter Teck: Die vor- und frühgeschichtlichen Funde im Heimatmuseum","creators":[{"firstName":"Resi","lastName":"Fiedler","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"}],"dateAdded":"2022-07-13T15:44:54Z","dateModified":"2022-07-13T15:46:41Z","itemID":16751,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fiedler1962KatalogKirchheim"},{"key":"JHI3EVBQ","version":13208,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"19","pages":"53-190","publicationTitle":"Rhein.

In Europe, millet was reported in Early Neolithic contexts formed by 6000 bc, but recent radiocarbon dating of a dozen 'early' grains cast doubt on these claims. Archaeobotanical evidence reveals that millet was common in Europe from the 2nd millennium bc, when major societal and economic transformations took place in the Bronze Age. We conducted an extensive programme of AMS-dating of charred broomcorn millet grains from 75 prehistoric sites in Europe. Our Bayesian model reveals that millet cultivation began in Europe at the earliest during the sixteenth century bc, and spread rapidly during the fifteenth/fourteenth centuries bc. Broomcorn millet succeeds in exceptionally wide range of growing conditions and completes its lifecycle in less than three summer months. Offering an additional harvest and thus surplus food/fodder, it likely was a transformative innovation in European prehistoric agriculture previously based mainly on (winter) cropping of wheat and barley. We provide a new, high-resolution chronological framework for this key agricultural development that likely contributed to far-reaching changes in lifestyle in late 2nd millennium bc Europe.","title":"New AMS 14C dates track the arrival and spread of broomcorn millet cultivation and agricultural change in prehistoric Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Dragana","lastName":"Filipović","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Meadows","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marta Dal","lastName":"Corso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wiebke","lastName":"Kirleis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Almuth","lastName":"Alsleben","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Örni","lastName":"Akeret","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Bittmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanna","lastName":"Bosi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beatrice","lastName":"Ciută","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dagmar","lastName":"Dreslerová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henrike","lastName":"Effenberger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ferenc","lastName":"Gyulai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas G.","lastName":"Heiss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Hellmund","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Jahns","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Jakobitsch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Magda","lastName":"Kapcia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefanie","lastName":"Klooß","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marianne","lastName":"Kohler-Schneider","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Kroll","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Przemysław","lastName":"Makarowicz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Marinova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tanja","lastName":"Märkle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Medović","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna Maria","lastName":"Mercuri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aldona","lastName":"Mueller-Bieniek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Nisbet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Galina","lastName":"Pashkevich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Renata","lastName":"Perego","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Pokorný","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pospieszny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Przybyła","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kelly","lastName":"Reed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Rennwanz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hans-Peter","lastName":"Stika","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Astrid","lastName":"Stobbe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tjaša","lastName":"Tolar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krystyna","lastName":"Wasylikowa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Wiethold","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tanja","lastName":"Zerl","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:20Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:20Z","itemID":11096,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FilipovicEtAl2020NewAMS"},{"key":"K43JCWYA","version":2198,"itemType":"journalArticle","date":"03.02.2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5799","title":"All-in-one: Ein universelles Handgerät vom »Bornhöck«","creators":[{"firstName":"Juliane","lastName":"Filipp","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Knochengeräte"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:59Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:52:59Z","itemID":8260,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Filipp2015AllinoneUniverselles"},{"key":"3WA6N9VG","version":25457,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Tagungen des Landesmuseums für Vorgeschichte Halle","place":"Halle/Saale","pages":"407-424","date":"2016","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6286","seriesNumber":"14","title":"Dieskau und Helmsdorf – Zwei frühbronzezeitliche Mikroregionen im Vergleich","creators":[{"firstName":"Juliane","lastName":"Filipp","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Freudenreich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Hans Peter","lastName":"Hahn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Jung","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Risch","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Mitteldeutschland"},{"tag":"Sachsen-Anhalt"},{"tag":"Fürstengrab"},{"tag":"Grabhügel"}],"dateAdded":"2021-11-24T09:04:56Z","dateModified":"2024-10-10T11:32:07Z","itemID":12429,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FilippFreudenreich2016DieskauUnd","publicationTitle":"Arm und Reich - Zur Ressourcenverteilung in prähistorischen Gesellschaften.

This problem is especially important in archaeology, where increasing empirical evidence illustrates ways of life that are not easily encompassed within the range of variation recognised in the contemporary world of surviving hunter-gatherers. Put simply, how do past hunter-gatherers fit into our understandings of hunter-gatherers? Furthermore, given the inevitable archaeological reliance on analogy, it is important to ask whether conceptions of hunter-gatherers based on contemporary societies restrict our comprehension of past diversity and of how this changes over the long term. Discussion of hunter-gatherers shows them to be varied and flexible, but modelling of contemporary hunter-gatherers has not only reduced them into essential categories, but has also portrayed them as static and without history. It is often said that the study of hunter-gatherers can provide insight into past forms of social organisation and behaviour; unfortunately too often it has limited our understandings of these societies. In contrast, contributors here explore past hunter-gather diversity over time and space to provide critical perspectives on general models of ‘hunter-gatherers’ and attempt to provide new perspectives on hunter-gatherer societies from the greater diversity present in the past.","title":"The Diversity of Hunter Gatherer Pasts","creators":[{"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Finlayson","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Graeme","lastName":"Warren","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mesolithikum"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"Jäger-Sammler"}],"dateAdded":"2017-12-18T08:31:23Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T11:12:37Z","itemID":357,"notes":[{"key":"C75DJHPT","version":7079,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"NZSJH9W7","note":"<div>\n<h1>Table of Contents</h1>\n<div>\n<div>Contributors</div>\n<div>Acknowledgements</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>1 The diversity of hunter-gatherer pasts: an introduction</div>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Bill Finlayson and Graeme Warren</div>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<div> </div>\n<div>PART 1: PATTERNS OF DIVERSITY AND CHANGE</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>2 Expanding notions of hunter-gatherer diversity: identifying core organisational principles and practices in Coast Salish societies of the northwest Coast of North America</div>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Colin Grier</div>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<div> </div>\n<div>3 Conceptualising subsistence in central Africa and the West over the longue durée</div>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Kathryn M. de Luna</div>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<div> </div>\n<div>4 The end of hunting and gathering</div>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Bill Finlayson</div>\n<div> </div>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<div>5 Okhotsk and Sushen: history and diversity in Iron Age Maritime hunter-gatherers of northern Japan</div>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Mark J.

We review paleoclimate data and reconstructions from the region with a focus on the last 6000 years. We aim to provide an up-to-date source of information on climate variability and to outline present limitations and future opportunities. The review work is threefold: (1) literature review, (2) spatial and temporal analysis of proxy records, and (3) statistical estimation of uncertainties in present paleoclimate reconstructions (temperature, °C). On a regional scale the review reveals a wetter situation from 6000 to 5400 yrs BP (note: all ages in this paper are in calibrated years before present (i.e. before 1950), abbreviated yrs BP, unless otherwise stated). This is followed by a less wet period leading up to one of fully-developed aridity from c. 4600 yrs BP. There is a need for more high-resolution paleoclimate records, in order to (i) better understand regional patterns and trends versus local climate variability and to (ii) fill the gap of data from some regions, such as the Near East, Greece and Egypt. Further, we evaluate the regional occurrence of a proposed widespread climate event at 4200 yrs BP. This proposed climate anomaly has been used to explain profound changes in human societies at different locations in the region around this time. We suggest that although aridity was widespread around 4200 yrs BP in the eastern Mediterranean region, there is not enough evidence to support the notion of a climate event with rapidly drying conditions in this region.","title":"Climate in the eastern Mediterranean, and adjacent regions, during the past 6000 years – A review","creators":[{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Finné","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Holmgren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hanna S.","lastName":"Sundqvist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erika","lastName":"Weiberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lindblom","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Ägäis"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"},{"tag":"Holozän"},{"tag":"4.2k Event"},{"tag":"Klimarekonstruktion"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:26Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:26Z","itemID":8376,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FinneEtAl2011ClimateEastern"},{"key":"7VA3ZYFM","version":3967,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"24","issue":"8","pages":"1002-1008","publicationTitle":"The Holocene","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6793","abstractNote":"Macroscopic charcoal records can be used to infer spatially explicit reconstructions of past fire history. However, a current deficiency in the charcoal-analysis toolbox has been the lack of a method to consider sampling variability and charcoal-particle area distributions for peak detection with charcoal-area records. We present a screening procedure specific for datasets comprising charcoal numbers and areas to screen the charcoal-area estimates with respect to the count sums. The rationale for screening charcoal-area peaks stems from the observation that although charcoal-area records can be more suitable in a statistical sense for peak detection (e.g. as established by the signal-to-noise index), charcoal-area peaks can be questionable if they are determined by just one or a few larger charcoal particles. Our method begins with a charcoal-area time series analysed by existing methods to identify peaks representing fire episodes. To screen these peaks, the method uses bootstrap resampling of charcoal-particle areas observed in a user-defined subsection of the record around each peak to obtain the range of likely charcoal areas for different counts. Peaks with total area within the likely range of bootstrapped samples (e.g. p > 0.05) are flagged as potentially unreliable, whereas samples with total area significantly greater than expected by chance are deemed robust indicators of past fire events. In an example application of the method to a charcoal record from Lake Brazi, Romania, several peaks failed to pass the screening suggesting that, as for count-based records, unscreened charcoal-area records may include spurious fire episodes and thus potentially underestimate past fire-return intervals.","title":"A guide to screening charcoal peaks in macrocharcoal-area records for fire-episode reconstructions","creators":[{"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Finsinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kelly","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jordan","lastName":"Fevre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Enikő K.","lastName":"Magyari","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Naturwissenschaft"},{"tag":"Feuer"},{"tag":"Holzkohle"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:03:41Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:03:41Z","itemID":10230,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FinsingerEtAl2014GuideScreening"},{"key":"RRB535HY","version":2031,"itemType":"book","series":"Numen book series,","place":"Leiden ; Boston","publisher":"Brill","ISBN":"9004150854 (hardback) 0169-8834 ;","date":"2007","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3368","seriesNumber":"v 112","title":"Human sacrifice in Jewish and Christian tradition","numPages":"xiii, 365 p.","creators":[{"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Finsterbusch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Lange","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Diethard","lastName":"Römheld","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Religion"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Bibel"},{"tag":"Christentum"},{"tag":"Judentum"},{"tag":"Kinderopfer"},{"tag":"Menschenopfer"},{"tag":"Opfer"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:41:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:41:56Z","itemID":4848,"notes":[{"key":"YRDL4QPG","version":2474,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"RRB535HY","note":"<p>2006051652<br/>GBA688567<br/>edited by Karin Finsterbusch, Armin Lange, K.F.

We documented here the genomic diversity of Iron Age communities originating from six French regions. The 49 acquired genomes permitted us to highlight an absence of discontinuity between Bronze Age and Iron Age groups in France, lending support to a cultural transition linked to progressive local economic changes rather than to a massive influx of allochthone groups. Genomic analyses revealed strong genetic homogeneity among the regional groups associated with distinct archaeological cultures. This genomic homogenization appears to be linked to individuals’ mobility between regions and gene flow with neighbouring groups from England and Spain. Thus, the results globally support a common genomic legacy for the Iron Age population of modern-day France that could be linked to recurrent gene flow between culturally differentiated communities.","title":"Origin and mobility of Iron Age Gaulish groups in present-day France revealed through archaeogenomics","creators":[{"firstName":"Claire-Elise","lastName":"Fischer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie-Hélène","lastName":"Pemonge","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Isaure","lastName":"Ducoussau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Arzelier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maïté","lastName":"Rivollat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Santos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hélène","lastName":"Barrand Emam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Bertaud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Beylier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Ciesielski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Dedet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sophie","lastName":"Desenne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henri","lastName":"Duday","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fanny","lastName":"Chenal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Gailledrat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sébastien","lastName":"Goepfert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Gorgé","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Gorgues","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gertrud","lastName":"Kuhnle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"François","lastName":"Lambach","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Lefort","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amandine","lastName":"Mauduit","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Maziere","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sophie","lastName":"Oudry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cécile","lastName":"Paresys","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Estelle","lastName":"Pinard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Suzanne","lastName":"Plouin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Isabelle","lastName":"Richard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"Roth-Zehner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Réjane","lastName":"Roure","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Corinne","lastName":"Thevenet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yohann","lastName":"Thomas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stéphane","lastName":"Rottier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie-France","lastName":"Deguilloux","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mélanie","lastName":"Pruvost","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2022-07-13T12:36:07Z","dateModified":"2022-07-13T15:08:37Z","itemID":16749,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FischerEtAl2022OriginMobility"},{"key":"JNZC3AUA","version":23314,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297032","volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":"e0297032","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"14 Feb 2024","extra":"Publisher: Public Library of Science","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0297032","accessDate":"2024-02-19T13:11:44Z","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","language":"en","abstractNote":"The lethally maltreated body of Vittrup Man was deposited in a Danish bog, probably as part of a ritualised sacrifice. It happened between c. 3300 and 3100 cal years BC, i.e., during the period of the local farming-based Funnel Beaker Culture. In terms of skull morphological features, he differs from the majority of the contemporaneous farmers found in Denmark, and associates with hunter-gatherers, who inhabited Scandinavia during the previous millennia. His skeletal remains were selected for transdisciplinary analysis to reveal his life-history in terms of a population historical perspective. We report the combined results of an integrated set of genetic, isotopic, physical anthropological and archaeological analytical approaches. Strontium signature suggests a foreign birthplace that could be in Norway or Sweden. In addition, enamel oxygen isotope values indicate that as a child he lived in a colder climate, i.e., to the north of the regions inhabited by farmers. Genomic data in fact demonstrates that he is closely related to Mesolithic humans known from Norway and Sweden. Moreover, dietary stable isotope analyses on enamel and bone collagen demonstrate a fisher-hunter way of life in his childhood and a diet typical of farmers later on. Such a variable life-history is also reflected by proteomic analysis of hardened organic deposits on his teeth, indicating the consumption of forager food (seal, whale and marine fish) as well as farmer food (sheep/goat). From a dietary isotopic transect of one of his teeth it is shown that his transfer between societies of foragers and farmers took place near to the end of his teenage years.","title":"Vittrup Man–The life-history of a genetic foreigner in Neolithic Denmark","creators":[{"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Fischer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karl-Göran","lastName":"Sjögren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Theis Zetner Trolle","lastName":"Jensen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie Louise","lastName":"Jørkov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Lysdahl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tharsika","lastName":"Vimala","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alba","lastName":"Refoyo-Martínez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Scorrano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.

We integrate survey data from two long-term regional projects, comparing natural environments, research histories, and site distributions in the Upper Swabian lowlands and the southeastern Swabian Alb plateau. Each area includes intensively investigated clusters of sites associated with distinctive landforms, surrounded by areas where settlement evidence is sparse or lacking. On the Swabian Alb, low- to high-density lithic scatters are dominated by Neolithic activities including settlement and chert acquisition. In the lowlands, Neolithic surface finds are scarce and dispersed, but their distribution suggests contact and travel between lowlands and the upland Swabian Alb study area.

The first large-scale DNA study interpreted major genetic replacement in Britain as being caused by large-scale movement from the Continent, while more detailed studies in Germany emphasise marriage as a reason for mobility. These studies employ models of Bell Beaker society in which social statuses were rigidly prescribed according to gender and age, but their results challenge these assumptions and also ones about family groups and households. There is no incontrovertible archaeological evidence to support large-scale migration, and the DNA results indicate that some similarities across the Bell Beaker network are not due to genetic relatedness, but shared ideas and religious beliefs, topics that have been neglected in recent work, but which deserve renewed attention.","title":"Bell Beaker Mobility: Marriage, Migration, and Mortality","shortTitle":"Bell Beaker Mobility","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew P.","lastName":"Fitzpatrick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Fernández-Götz","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Courtney","lastName":"Nimura","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Philipp W.","lastName":"Stockhammer","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Cartwright","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Migration"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2023-02-21T10:02:38Z","dateModified":"2023-12-21T14:27:21Z","itemID":31725,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fitzpatrick2022BellBeaker","publicationTitle":"Rethinking Migrations in Late Prehistoric Eurasia"},{"key":"XDRDJ33G","version":14586,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Oxford - Oakville","pages":"176-188","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4437","title":"In his hands and in his head: The Amesbury Archer as a metalworker","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Fitzpatrick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Clark","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Spätkupferzeit"},{"tag":"Metallurgen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:46:33Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T07:48:09Z","itemID":6033,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FitzpatrickHisHands","publicationTitle":"Bronze Age Connections.

Von besonderer Bedeutung für die Urnenfelderzeit-Forschung ist jedoch der Komplex von mehr 4.000 unverbrannten Menschenknochen, die ohne jeglichen anatomischen Verband in der Höhle aufgefunden wurden. Anhand umfangreicher genetischer Analysen ließen sich diese Skelettelemente 57 Individuen zuweisen, von denen 42 einem mindestens 4 – 5 Generationen umfassenden Familienclan mit vier genetisch eng verwandten Familiengruppen bilden. Anzahl und Zusammensetzung des menschlichen Knocheninventars sowie weitere Indizien lassen dabei kaum einen Zweifel daran, dass es sich bei den Knochenfunden in der Lichtensteinhöhle um sekundäre Deponierungen ausgewählter Skelettelemente handelt, und diese damit über fast ein Jahrhundert als Familiengruft fungiert hat. Erstmals kann damit für die Urnenfelderzeit ein regulär über einen längeren Zeitraum hinweg praktiziertes mehrphasiges Bestattungsbrauchtum mit Sekundärbestattungen in einer Höhle nachgewiesen werden. Das umfangreiche Fundinventar und die Vielzahl der Befunde aus der Lichtensteinhöhle“ gewähren darüber hinaus tiefe Einblicke in die begleitenden Begräbnisrituale und die Glaubensvorstellungen der urnenfelderzeitlichen Höhlennutzer, wie sie bisher für diese Epoche kaum möglich waren.

The attitude towards multiple births varies widely among cultures. Although expected to be present, evidence for twin burials from prehistoric times is scarce. However, knowledge about the attitude of ancient societies towards twins, as expressed for instance by funeral practices, would provide interesting insights into the spiritual world of these people. In 2001, an Iron-Age settlement site was excavated near Ochtendung, Germany. The skeletons of two perinatal individuals were found in situ in shallow depressions close to post-holes of a house pit in the western part of the settlement. The individuals appear to have been deposited in the depressions without special care, one of them face down. No archaeological findings were associated with the skeletons. Age at death of the two individuals was estimated to between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. The cusp patterns of the lower left first molars exhibit a similar configuration of the disto-buccal cusps in both individuals, probably a division of the hypoconid. The investigation of the bones and teeth revealed a similar stage of development of the individuals, and supports the hypothesis of closely related individuals, probably twins. An interpretation as “building sacrifices” seems unwarranted, considering the careless deposition of the bodies and the absence of any grave goods.

This had limited our understanding of the ancient Greek–Late Bronze Age–warfare and its consequences that have underpinned the social transformations of prehistoric Europe and Eastern Mediterranean. In a series of archeo-physiological studies, merging knowledge in archaeology, history, human physiology, and numerical simulation, we provide supporting evidence that the Mycenaean armour found at Dendra was entirely compatible with use in extended combat, and we provide a free software enabling simulation of Late Bronze Age warfare. A group of special armed-forces personnel wearing a replica of the Dendra armour were able to complete an 11-hour simulated Late Bronze Age combat protocol that we developed from a series of studies based on the available evidence. Numerical simulation of the thermal exchanges in Late Bronze Age warfare extended this conclusion across different environmental conditions and fighting intensities. Our results support the notion that the Mycenaeans had such a powerful impact in Eastern Mediterranean at least partly as a result of their armour technology.","title":"Analysis of Greek prehistoric combat in full body armour based on physiological principles: A series of studies using thematic analysis, human experiments, and numerical simulations","shortTitle":"Analysis of Greek prehistoric combat in full body armour based on physiological principles","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas D.","lastName":"Flouris","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stavros B.","lastName":"Petmezas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Panagiotis I.","lastName":"Asimoglou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"João P.","lastName":"Vale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tiago S.","lastName":"Mayor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giannis","lastName":"Giakas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Athanasios Z.","lastName":"Jamurtas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yiannis","lastName":"Koutedakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Wardle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Diana","lastName":"Wardle","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Krieg"},{"tag":"Ägäis"},{"tag":"Krieger"},{"tag":"Defensivbewaffnung"},{"tag":"Ägäische Bronzezeit"}],"dateAdded":"2024-07-05T05:51:34Z","dateModified":"2024-07-05T05:51:34Z","itemID":32305,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FlourisEtAl2024AnalysisGreek"},{"key":"KFCU68QL","version":22983,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Göttingen","publisher":"Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht","pages":"77-99","date":"2021","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","title":"Kritische Gedanken zu Zentrum und Peripherie in der (Vor- und) Frühgeschichtlichen Archäologie","creators":[{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Flückiger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Bemmann","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Dittmar","lastName":"Dahlmann","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Detlev","lastName":"Taranczewski","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Raumkonzepte"},{"tag":"Raumanalyse"},{"tag":"Weltsystem"},{"tag":"Core-Periphery Theory"}],"dateAdded":"2023-12-21T15:11:12Z","dateModified":"2023-12-21T15:17:01Z","itemID":31737,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fluckiger2021KritischeGedanken","publicationTitle":"Core, Periphery, Frontier – Spatial Patterns of Power"},{"key":"5H8EHMZA","version":22984,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Schriftenreihe Studien zu Spätantike und Frühmittelalter","place":"Hamburg","publisher":"Verlag Dr. Kovač","ISBN":"978-3-339-13700-5","date":"2023","extra":"Meeting Name: Arbeitsgemeinschaft Spätantike und Frühmittelalter","seriesNumber":"11","libraryCatalog":"K10plus ISBN","language":"de","title":"Was heißt schon „zentral”?

Battlefield archaeology is one of the newest areas of archaeological investigation, originating in work at the Little Bighorn (USA) in 1984. Here we see the results of using these methods in the UK, including at iconic sites such as Bosworth and Towton. The Archaeology of English Battlefields presents the results of the first national assessment of English battlefields. The primary written sources are complemented by the results of extensive fieldwork, computer-based terrain reconstruction, and scientific analysis of artefacts recovered from battlefields, allowing the sites of several notable battles to be located firmly for the first time. Battlefield archaeology rests heavily on the recording of metal artefact scatters across the landscape, and the book explores the most effective way of recovering this material. The authors' proposed methodology for investigating battlefield locations is validated by the recent identification of the precise location of the Battle of Bosworth, some 3km from the traditional site. Experiments on ordnance recovered from battlefields are enhancing our understanding of the development of gunpowder weapons. The evidence for battles from prehistory to the mid fifteenth century is summarised and is followed by detailed descriptions of battles from the Wars of the Roses, as well as notable conflicts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The book concludes with some suggestions for the future management of these important sites.","title":"The Archaeology of English Battlefields: Conflict in the Pre-industrial Landscape","creators":[{"firstName":"Glenn","lastName":"Foard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Morris","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Krieg"},{"tag":"Schlachtfeldarchäologie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:54:13Z","itemID":8659,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FoardMorris2012ArchaeologyEnglish"},{"key":"PURYXJRD","version":4276,"itemType":"book","place":"Düsseldorf","date":"1937","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4302","title":"Die steinzeitlichen Keulen Mitteleuropas","creators":[{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Fock","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Mitteldeutschland"},{"tag":"Steinartefakte"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:46:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:46:00Z","itemID":5842,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fock1937SteinzeitlichenKeulen"},{"key":"2A6NGV33","version":10385,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296639986_Access_to_origins_on_the_meaning_of_continuity_and_discontinuity_in_the_use_of_barrow_%27cemeteries%27","series":"Bodenaltertümer Westfalens","place":"Darmstadt","publisher":"von Zabern","pages":"553 ff.","date":"2012","seriesNumber":"51","title":"Access to origins: about the meaning of continuity and discontinuity in the use of barrow ‘cemeteries","creators":[{"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Fokkens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Bérenger","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Bourgeois","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wirth","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Früheisenzeit"},{"tag":"Niederlande"},{"tag":"Kreisgraben"},{"tag":"Pfostenkreis"},{"tag":"Pfostenreihen"},{"tag":"Grabeinfriedung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-11-23T08:58:52Z","dateModified":"2021-11-23T09:02:29Z","itemID":12377,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fokkens2012AccessOrigins","publicationTitle":"Gräberlandschaften der Bronzezeit.

Het traditionele beeld van deze periode uit de geschiedenis - het laat-neolithicum, de vroege bronstijd en de middenbronstijd - was voornamelijk gebaseerd op aangetroffen graven en bronsdepots. Uit deze synthese blijkt echter dat de laatste jaren ook veel gegevens over nederzettingen zijn verzameld. Daarmee moet onze perceptie van de periode van de zogeheten klokbekercultuur aanzienlijk worden bijgesteld.

Er wordt gepleit voor een veel meer geïntegreerde aanpak door alle specialisten die betrokken zijn bij archeologische veldwerk en de analyse daarvan. Sinds vijftien jaar zijn ontwikkelaars en initiatiefnemers van ruimtelijke ontwikkelingen verplicht om archeologisch onderzoek uit te laten voeren. Dit heeft geleid tot een grote hoeveelheid onderzoeken. Honderden vindplaatsen zijn onderzocht, met honderden onderzoeksrapporten als resultaat.

A.E. van Giffen, the nestor of Dutch Archaeology, excavated two burial mounds near Oostwoud, on a parcel named ‘Tuithoorn’ in de province of Noord-Holland. These mounds appeared to have been erected in the Late Neolithic between 2500 and 1900 cal BC. They contained at least 12 well preserved skeletons dating to the Late Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age. The present article is an attempt to re-analyse the data of the investigations by Van Giffen, but also of later research by M. de Weerd in 1963 and 1966, and by J.D. Van der Waals in 1977 and J.N. Lanting in 1978 in the same mounds. In the framework of the NWO-project Farmers of the Coast, the first author undertook the task to collect the dispersed data and to try to unravel the sequences of burial. Aided by the Leiden University Bakels fund, and a fund of the Province of Noord-Holland, we also had the opportunity to sample the bones for DNA and isotopes, and to study the pathology of the skeletons. Some of the analyses are not yet finished, but here we publish the excavation data using the original field drawings and day notes, and much of the original photography. We have done this in some detail because the site is one of the most important in its kind in the Netherlands and because it will play an important role in the discussion about Bell Beaker mobility and genetics in the near future.","title":"Excavations of Late Neolithic arable, burial mounds and a number of well-preserved skeletons at Oostwoud-Tuithoorn: a re-analysis of old data","shortTitle":"Fokkens, Veselka et al. – Excavations of Late Neolithic arable","creators":[{"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Fokkens","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Veselka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Quentin","lastName":"Bourgeois","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iñigo","lastName":"Olalde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Hügelgrab"},{"tag":"Kreisgraben"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:03:04Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:03:04Z","itemID":10108,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FokkensEtAl2017ExcavationsLate"},{"key":"Q8K2SF9N","version":8150,"itemType":"book","place":"Leiden","publisher":"Sidestone Press","date":"2012","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4908","abstractNote":"Background to Beakers is the result of an inspiring session at the yearly conference of European Association of Archaeologists in The Hague in September 2010. The conference brought together thirteen speakers on the subject Beakers in Transition. Together we explored the background to the Bell Beaker complex in different regions, departing from the idea that migration is not the comprehensive solution to the adoption of Bell Beakers. Therefore we asked the participants to discuss how in their region Beakers were incorporated in existing cultural complexes, as one of the manners to understand the processes of innovation that were undoubtedly part of the Beaker complex.\nIn this book eight of the speakers have contributed papers, resulting in a diverse and interesting approach to Beakers. We can see how scholars in Scandinavia, the Low Countries, Poland, Switzerland, France, Morocco even, struggle with the same problems, but have different solutions everywhere. The book reads as an inspiration for new approaches and for a discussion of cultural backgrounds instead of searching for the oldest Beaker.\nThe authors are all established scholars in the field of Bronze Age research. Of the editors Harry Fokkens is a professor of European Prehistory at Leiden University and well known for his research in the Low Countries and in a broader European context. He published several books on settlement research, amongst others Bronze Age settlements in the Low Countries (Oxbow 2008, with S. Arnoldussen). Franco Nicolis is the Director of the Heritage Office of the autonomous Province of Trento and published many articles and books on Bell Beakers.

This book aims to make sense of this fascinating, yet puzzling social practice. It does so by focusing on a period in history in which such destructive behavior reached unseen heights and complexity: the Bronze Age in Europe (c. 2300-500 BC). This period is often seen as the time in which the first 'familiar' Europe took shape due to the rise of a metal-based economy. But it was also during the Bronze Age that massive amounts of scarce and recyclable metal were deliberately buried in the landscape and never taken out again. This systematic deposition of metalwork sits uneasily with our prevailing perception of the Bronze Age as the first 'rational-economic' period in history - and therewith - of ourselves. Taking the patterned archaeological evidence of these seemingly un-economic metalwork depositions at face value, it is shown that the 'un-economic' giving-up of metal valuables was an integral part of what a Bronze Age 'economy' was about. Written as an extended essay and based on case studies from Bronze Age Europe, this book attempts to reconcile the seemingly conflicting political and cultural approaches that are currently used to understand this pivotal period in Europe's deep history. Using theories from economic anthropology, this book argues that -paradoxically - giving up that which was valuable created value. It shows that to achieve something in society, something else must be given up\"--","title":"Economies of destruction: how the systematic destruction of valuables created value in Bronze Age Europe, c. 2300-500 BC","shortTitle":"Economies of destruction","creators":[{"firstName":"David R.","lastName":"Fontijn","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Fragmentierung"},{"tag":"Hallstattzeit"},{"tag":"monetäre Systeme"}],"dateAdded":"2023-03-01T09:47:52Z","dateModified":"2023-03-01T09:49:37Z","itemID":30926,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fontijn2019EconomiesDestruction"},{"key":"KJL5FWEV","version":11468,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781009042826%23CN-bp-4/type/book_part","edition":"1","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","pages":"90-105","ISBN":"978-1-009-04282-6 978-1-316-51539-6 978-1-009-04576-6","date":"2021-10-31","extra":"DOI: 10.1017/9781009042826.005","accessDate":"2021-12-03T09:45:44Z","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Power Requires Others: “Institutional Realities” and the Significance of Individual Power in Late Prehistoric Europe","shortTitle":"Power Requires Others","creators":[{"firstName":"T.

Yet, not much is known on how \"barrow landscapes\" came into being . This book deals with that topic, by presenting the results of archaeological research carried out on a group of just two barrows that crown a small hilltop near the Echoput (\"echo-well\") in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.\nIn 2007, archaeologists of the Ancestral Mounds project of Leiden University carried out an excavation of parts of these mounds and their immediate environment. They discovered that these mounds are rare examples of monumental barrows from the later part of the Iron Age. They were probably built at the same time, and their similarities are so conspicuous that one might speak of \"twin barrows\".\nThe research team was able to reconstruct the long-term history of this hilltop. We can follow how the hilltop that is now deep in the forests of the natural reserve of the Kroondomein Het Loo, once was an open place in the landscape. With pragmatism not unlike our own, we see how our prehistoric predecessors carefully managed and maintained the open area for a long time, before it was transformed into a funerary site. The excavation yielded many details on how people built the barrows by cutting and arranging heather sods, and how the mounds were used for burial rituals in the Iron Age. 174p, 26 b/w; 72 colour illus (Sidestone Press 2012)","title":"Iron Age Echoes: Prehistoric land management and the creation of a funerary landscape","creators":[{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Fontijn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Quentin","lastName":"Bourgeois","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Arjen","lastName":"Louwen","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Niederlande"},{"tag":"Hügelgrab"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:49:09Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:28:58Z","itemID":6866,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FontijnEtAl2012IronAge"},{"key":"G2NJXBNK","version":8150,"itemType":"book","place":"Leiden","publisher":"Sidestone","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5994","title":"Transformation Through Destruction.

Based on evidence from the first stable isotope analysis on Pitted Ware skeletal material from the Eastern Central Swedish mainland, we suggest that this identity was shared by PWC groups in the archipelago of the west side of the Baltic. Fifty-six faunal and 26 human bone and dentine samples originating from the Pitted Ware site Korsnäs in Södermanland, Sweden were analysed, and the data clearly shows that the diet of the Korsnäs people was marine, predominantly based on seal. The isotope data further indicate that the pig bones found in large quantities on the site emanate from wild boar rather than domestic pigs. The large representation of pig on several Pitted Ware sites, which cannot be explained in terms of economy, is interpreted as the results of occasional hunting of and ritual feasting on wild boar, indicating that the animal held a prominent position, alongside seal, in the hunting identity and cosmology of the Pitted Ware people. Further, eleven new radiocarbon dates are presented, placing the Korsnäs site, with a large probability, within Middle Neolithic A.","title":"Wild at heart: Approaching Pitted Ware identity, economy and cosmology through stable isotopes in skeletal material from the Neolithic site Korsnäs in Eastern Central Sweden","creators":[{"firstName":"Elin","lastName":"Fornander","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gunilla","lastName":"Eriksson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kerstin","lastName":"Lidén","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"},{"tag":"Identität"},{"tag":"Schweden"},{"tag":"Grübchenkeramik Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:12Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:45:12Z","itemID":5640,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FornanderEtAl2008WildHeart"},{"key":"CWVP3FF4","version":4137,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Prague","pages":"214-227","date":"2004","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2587","title":"Large ditched enclosure at Chleby (distr.

Twenty-seven individuals are part of the first extended pedigree reconstructed from ancient DNA, a five-generation family whose many interrelationships provide statistical power to document kinship practices that were invisible without direct genetic data. Patrilineal descent was key in determining who was buried in the tomb, as all 15 intergenerational transmissions were through men. The presence of women who had reproduced with lineage men and the absence of adult lineage daughters suggest virilocal burial and female exogamy. We demonstrate that one male progenitor reproduced with four women: the descendants of two of those women were buried in the same half of the tomb over all generations. This suggests that maternal sub-lineages were grouped into branches whose distinctiveness was recognized during the construction of the tomb. Four men descended from non-lineage fathers and mothers who also reproduced with lineage male individuals, suggesting that some men adopted the children of their reproductive partners by other men into their patriline. Eight individuals were not close biological relatives of the main lineage, raising the possibility that kinship also encompassed social bonds independent of biological relatedness.","title":"A high-resolution picture of kinship practices in an Early Neolithic tomb","creators":[{"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Fowler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iñigo","lastName":"Olalde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vicki","lastName":"Cummings","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Armit","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lindsey","lastName":"Büster","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Cuthbert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadin","lastName":"Rohland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Cheronet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Pinhasi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Kollektivgrab"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Langhügel"},{"tag":"Kinship"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2022-01-12T08:26:36Z","dateModified":"2022-01-12T08:26:36Z","itemID":12691,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FowlerEtAl2021HighresolutionPicture"},{"key":"SA9NNC9Z","version":8150,"itemType":"book","series":"BAR Int.

Its multiple resonances and experiences extend far beyond the nutritive consumption of food and drink by a group of people. To understand a feasting event more comprehensively, it is necessary to analyse the whole series of experiences that the original participant would have undergone during the course of a feast, and to trace the footsteps of the diner through each stage of what was presumably a major event in his/her calendar. While the author examines the totality of feasting occasions in this book, her principal focus lies on how feasts serve as an arena for social negotiations: the creation of obligations to a powerful host, the cohesion augmented between companions, the privileging of high-status individuals, the emphasised inferiority of those of lesser status, and the creation of new connections through shared emotive experiences. This work thus explores on a broad scale the multi-faceted use of feasting in mainland Greece by placing it in a diachronic perspective, commencing at the beginning of the Early Mycenaean period (MHIII/LHI) and continuing to the end of the Early Iron Age (EIA). This long-range study is given focus by viewing it specifically from the angle of social changes, developments and negotiations, in order to analyse how socio-political events in Greece throughout the nine centuries under consideration both affected commensal events and were directly or indirectly produced by them.","title":"Feasting Practices and Changes in Greek Society from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age","creators":[{"firstName":"Rachel Sarah","lastName":"Fox","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Religion"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Früheisenzeit"},{"tag":"Feasting"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Ägäis"},{"tag":"Griechenland"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:49:01Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:29:27Z","itemID":6812,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fox2012FeastingPractices"},{"key":"2L64WFXT","version":2117,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"53","issue":"1","pages":"2-38","publicationTitle":"Current Anthropology","date":"2012","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4863","abstractNote":"In this article I present a new archaeological synthesis concerning the earliest formation of mobile pastoralist economies across central Eurasia. I argue that Eurasian steppe pastoralism developed along distinct local trajectories in the western, central, and (south)eastern steppe, sparking the development of regional networks of interaction in the late fourth and third millennia BC. The “Inner Asian Mountain Corridor” exemplifies the relationship between such incipient regional networks and the process of economic change in the eastern steppe territory. The diverse regional innovations, technologies, and ideologies evident across Eurasia in the mid-third millennium BC are cast as the building blocks of a unique political economy shaped by “nonuniform” institutional alignments among steppe populations throughout the second millennium BC. This theoretical model illustrates how regional channels of interaction between distinct societies positioned Eurasian mobile pastoralists as key players in wide-scale institutional developments among traditionally conceived “core” civilizations while also enabling them to remain strategically independent and small-scale in terms of their own sociopolitical organization. The development of nonuniform institutional complexity among Eurasian pastoralists demonstrates a unique political and economic structure applicable to societies whose variable political and territorial scales are inconsistent with commonly understood evolutionary or corporate sociopolitical typologies such as chiefdoms, states, or empires.","title":"Multiregional Emergence of Mobile Pastoralism and Nonuniform Institutional Complexity across Eurasia","creators":[{"firstName":"Michael D.","lastName":"Frachetti","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Eurasien"},{"tag":"Pontikum"},{"tag":"Sozialstruktur"},{"tag":"Sozialarchäologie"},{"tag":"Reiternomaden"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:48:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:48:49Z","itemID":6726,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Frachetti2012MultiregionalEmergence"},{"key":"ESR5N67N","version":27613,"itemType":"book","date":"2009","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2706","title":"Human and Nonhuman Bone Identification.

This study analyzed stable carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes from bones and teeth of 18th-19th century North Americans of known ancestry, social class, and region of origin in an effort to discern qualitative patterns and create a quantitative predictive model of demographic information. The δ13Ccollagen, δ13Cstructural carbonate, and δ18Ostructural carbonate values provide the most overall information for detecting demographic differences, with δ15Ncollagen and δ18Ophosphate to a lesser degree. Region of origin was the most predictable demographic factor with 82% correct classifications based on a two-variable model using δ13Ccollagen and δ18Ometeoric water calculated from δ18Ostructural carbonate, which reflects the influence of dominant local vegetation types and local drinking water. Ancestry was correctly identified in 68% of cases using δ13Ccollagen. Social class was less predictable with correct identification in 60% of cases based on δ13C, δ15N, and δ18O values where the upper class was most distinguishable. Isotope patterns observed in ancestry and social class groups are linked to cultural food preferences and food availability. Certain sample sites, such as military burials and urban cemeteries, show a greater range of isotope values suggesting a variety of individual regional origins and cultural backgrounds. Burials of extreme upper or lower class individuals show greater isotopic homogeneity suggesting reliance on localized food sources or cultural preferences for particular dietary choices.","title":"Stable isotope indicators of provenance and demographics in 18th and 19th century North Americans","creators":[{"firstName":"A.

The area around Seddin in north-western Brandenburg, Germany, has long been considered as at the core of one such networks. The degree of which the exchange practices involved in the circulations of goods and ideas was facilitated by people of different origins settling along the networks remains to be understood. To address this question, this study presents Sr isotope data of 29 cremated petrous bones from five neighbouring Late Bronze Age burial sites around Seddin, including the 9th century BCE Wickbold I burial mound. Modern environmental samples and archaeological soil samples were also analysed for 87Sr/86Sr to establish a bioavailable reference baseline for the region. The results suggest that modern water and archaeological soil samples appear to be best suited proxies for defining a 87Sr/86Sr baseline that can reliably be used to trace Bronze Age mobility at Seddin, while the modern soil and plant sample 87Sr/86Sr data seem to reflect changes inherent to natural carbonate leaching of the glaciogenic surface sediments over time and/or recent anthropogenic contamination, such as fertilizers, rendering their use as representative archives for bioavailable Sr in the study of past human mobility, at least in the greater Seddin region, problematic. The comparison of the petrous bone 87Sr/86Sr signatures to the proposed water Sr isotope baseline reveals an overwhelming presence of non-locals in the investigated grave sites, with only two of 22 individuals falling within the local baseline. This study suggests complex mobility patterns of the elite community around Seddin during the Late Bronze Age.","title":"A Late Bronze Age foreign elite?

To address this conundrum, we obtained mitochondrial and nuclear data from modern and ancient Near Eastern and European pigs. Our analyses indicate that, aside from a coat color gene, most Near Eastern ancestry in the genomes of European domestic pigs disappeared over 3,000 y as a result of interbreeding with local wild boars. This implies that pigs were not domesticated independently in Europe, yet the first 2,500 y of human-mediated selection applied by Near Eastern Neolithic farmers played little role in the development of modern European pigs.Archaeological evidence indicates that pig domestication had begun by ∼10,500 y before the present (BP) in the Near East, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggests that pigs arrived in Europe alongside farmers ∼8,500 y BP. A few thousand years after the introduction of Near Eastern pigs into Europe, however, their characteristic mtDNA signature disappeared and was replaced by haplotypes associated with European wild boars. This turnover could be accounted for by substantial gene flow from local European wild boars, although it is also possible that European wild boars were domesticated independently without any genetic contribution from the Near East. To test these hypotheses, we obtained mtDNA sequences from 2,099 modern and ancient pig samples and 63 nuclear ancient genomes from Near Eastern and European pigs. Our analyses revealed that European domestic pigs dating from 7,100 to 6,000 y BP possessed both Near Eastern and European nuclear ancestry, while later pigs possessed no more than 4% Near Eastern ancestry, indicating that gene flow from European wild boars resulted in a near-complete disappearance of Near East ancestry. In addition, we demonstrate that a variant at a locus encoding black coat color likely originated in the Near East and persisted in European pigs. Altogether, our results indicate that while pigs were not independently domesticated in Europe, the vast majority of human-mediated selection over the past 5,000 y focused on the genomic fraction derived from the European wild boars, and not on the fraction that was selected by early Neolithic farmers over the first 2,500 y of the domestication process.","title":"Ancient pigs reveal a near-complete genomic turnover following their introduction to Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Laurent A.
