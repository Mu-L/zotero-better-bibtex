Methods 783 archaeological skulls from the Tel Aviv University osteological collection were examined for evidence of trauma. The specimens were divided into three periods: Chalcolithic-Bronze-Iron Age (4300–520 BCE), Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine Period (332 BCE-640 CE), and Early and Late Arab Period (640–1917 CE). The characteristics of injury on each skull were recorded. Results A high frequency (25%) of traumatic lesions to the skull was evident among historic populations of the southern Levant, a rate that did not fluctuate significantly over 6,000 years. The most common pattern of trauma was minor circular depressed injuries. Most of the injuries were located on the parietal or frontal bones. Traumatic lesions were more frequent in males than in females, and in mature individuals than in adolescents and children, during all periods. Conclusions The rate of trauma in the southern Levantine populations was shown to be considerably higher than in other archaeological populations worldwide. The fact that no significant differences in trauma rates were found over time implies that socio-economical shifts (from agrarian to urban populations) had little impact on the local populations’ aggressive behavior. In contrast, changes in type of injury, from blunt force trauma to sharp force trauma and eventually projectile trauma, reflects changes in weaponry over time. The accumulated characteristics of cranial trauma pattern (type, location, side, size, sex, age) suggest that most of the individuals studied were not engaged directly in warfare. Rather, most injuries seem to be due to blows given during interpersonal violent encounters.

The identification of individuals buried in mass graves has long benefitted from traditional historical, archaeological, anthropological and paleopathological techniques. The addition of novel methods including genetic, genomic and isotopic geochemistry have renewed interest in solving unidentified mass graves. In this study, we demonstrate that the combined use of these techniques allows the identification of the individuals found in two Breton historical mass graves, where one method alone would not have revealed the importance of this discovery. The skeletons likely belong to soldiers from the two enemy armies who fought during a major event of Breton history: the siege of Rennes in 1491, which ended by the wedding of the Duchess of Brittany with the King of France and signaled the end of the independence of the region. Our study highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches with a particular emphasis on increasingly accurate isotopic markers. The development of the sulfur isoscape and testing of the triple isotope geographic assignment are detailed in a companion paper [13].","title":"The last battle of Anne of Brittany: Solving mass grave through an interdisciplinary approach (paleopathology, biological anthropology, history, multiple isotopes and radiocarbon dating)","shortTitle":"The last battle of Anne of Brittany","creators":[{"firstName":"Rozenn","lastName":"Colleter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clément P.","lastName":"Bataille","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henri","lastName":"Dabernat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Pichot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Hamon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sylvie","lastName":"Duchesne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Françoise","lastName":"Labaune-Jean","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stéphane","lastName":"Jean","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gaétan Le","lastName":"Cloirec","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Milano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Trost","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Steinbrenner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marine","lastName":"Marchal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Céline","lastName":"Guilbeau-Frugier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Telmon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Éric","lastName":"Crubézy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Klervia","lastName":"Jaouen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Krieg"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Mittelalter"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-02T06:51:28Z","dateModified":"2021-06-02T06:51:28Z","itemID":449,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ColleterEtAl2021LastBattle"},{"key":"C8DIGGZ4","version":2249,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2016","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6339","abstractNote":"The principal aim of this study is to put forward a technological and typological analysis of the industries of the Early Neolithic concerned in the process of neolithisation in several regions of Southern Italy. The rooting concepts are centred on the principles of the lithic technology outlined by J. Tixier, H. Roche, and M.-L. Inizan, D. Binder, C. Perlès, N. Pigeot et J. Pelegrin. The lithic series examined belong to the different horizons concerned in the process of Neolithitisation of Southern Italy in several areas of the envisaged region. In a view to reconstruct the economy of débitage and the economy of raw materials and the possible formation of technical traditions, this research is based on the following points: the economic and petrographic analysis of the raw materials; the analysis of the technological aspects and of the technical facts; the typometrical analysis of the different products of the chaînes opératoires; the typological analysis through the creation of an inventory allowing to integrate the study of the technological criteria with that of specific characters of the lithic tools. The main targets of this research are to highlight the methods and the techniques of débitage and to identify the chaînes opératoires set up by the early groups of farmers in the South of Italy and in Sicily. Is it possible to recognize a techno-economic variability in the débitage systems of the Early Neolithic of Southern Italy? Is it possible to give a cultural value to the variability of technical facts? What is the rate of continuity and discontinuity among groups of hunters-gatherers and the first farming societies? These questions shed light on the whole of technical and cultural transformations between the seventh and sixth millennium B.C. in the South of Italy, a region that played a key role in the process of diffusion of Neolithic towards the West Mediterranean.","title":"Le Néolithique ancien en Italie du sud.

Critiques of this approach have generally focused on the various problems that may undermine the validity of this assumption. Here, instead, we presume a perfect correspondence between population size and the quantity of datable material produced at any given time, and explore the question of how well summed 14C calibrations can track demographic changes under such ideal circumstances. We introduce a method of generating a random sample of simulated 14C determinations, from a specified distribution, with variable data densities and measurement errors. In other words, we generate a random sample of 14C dates not from an ideal statistical distribution but rather using a defined population curve to determine the probability distribution from which the calendar dates of the simulated 14C samples are drawn. We generate simulated 14C ages for these samples, calibrate them, and sum those calibrations. We compare the resulting proxy population curve to the known population distribution from which it was generated, to see whether known population fluctuations are unambiguously visible on a proxy curve derived from 14C data sets that are realistic in terms of the number and precision of the 14C determinations included. Results highlight 1) the critical role played by the magnitude and duration of any population fluctuation, and 2) the importance of sample size, and the reality that the numbers of samples required to detect significant population changes are generally far higher than those available to researchers proposing demographic reconstructions on the basis of literature searches for radiocarbon dates. We conclude that even if archaeological 14C data sets could be corrected for taphonomic filters and research biases, demographic signals would be difficult to distinguish from statistical noise in summed probability distributions. We suggest that simulation studies should be integral components of any attempt to reconstruct prehistoric demography from 14C dates.","title":"Summed radiocarbon calibrations as a population proxy: a critical evaluation using a realistic simulation approach","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel A.","lastName":"Contreras","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Meadows","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Demografie"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Simulation"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:48Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:52:48Z","itemID":8166,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ContrerasMeadows2014SummedRadiocarbon"},{"key":"PDVFV9JD","version":2081,"itemType":"book","series":"BAR Int.

Developing the argument that variations in artefact deposition over time and space can only be understood if different ‘types’ of find location are considered together holistically, we contend that it is also vital to look at the points where traditionally defined contexts of deposition become blurred into one another. In this paper, we investigate one particular such category – body-less object deposits at funerary sites – in later prehistoric Britain. This category of evidence has never previously been analysed collectively, let alone over the extended time period considered here. On the basis of a substantial body of evidence collected as part of a nationwide survey, we demonstrate that body-less object deposits were a significant component of funerary sites during later prehistory. Consequently, we go on to question whether human remains were actually always a necessary element of funerary deposits for prehistoric people, suggesting that the absence of human bone could be a positive attribute rather than simply a negative outcome of taphonomic processes. We also argue that modern, fixed depositional categories sometimes serve to mask a full understanding of the complex realities of past practice and ask whether it might be productive in some instances to move beyond interpretively confining terms such as ‘grave’, ‘hoard’ and ‘cenotaph’. Our research demonstrates that is it not only interesting in itself to scrutinize archaeological evidence that does not easily fit into traditional narratives, but that the process of doing so also sheds new light on the validity of our present-day categories, enabling deeper insights into how people in the past ordered their material and conceptual worlds. Whilst our main focus is later prehistoric Britain, the issues we consider are potentially relevant across all periods and regions.","title":"Spectrums of depositional practice in later prehistoric Britain and beyond.

Chapters cover the development of Grooved Ware in Orkney as well as the timing and nature of its appearance, development, and subsequent demise in different regions of Britain and Ireland. In addition, thematic papers consider what Grooved Ware can contribute to understandings of inter-regional interactions during the earlier 3rd millennium cal BC, the possible meaning of Grooved Ware's decorative motifs, and the thorny issue of the validity and significance of the various Grooved Ware sub-styles.

Despite their various roles, and in spite of the demographic composition of ancient societies where children comprised a large percentage of the population, children are almost completely missing in many current archaeological discourses. To remedy this, The Archaeology of Childhood aims to instigate interdisciplinary dialogues between archaeologists and other disciplines on the notion of childhood and children and to develop theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze the archaeological record in order to explore and understand children and their role in the formation of past cultures. Contributors consider how the notion of childhood can be expressed in artifacts and material records and examine how childhood is described in literary and historical sources of people from different regions and cultures. While we may never be able to reconstruct every last aspect of what childhood was like in the past, this volume argues that we can certainly bring children back into archaeological thinking and research, and correct many erroneous and gender-biased interpretations.","title":"The Archaeology of Childhood: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on an Archaeological Enigma","creators":[{"firstName":"Guner","lastName":"Coskunsu","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kind"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:56:05Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:20:38Z","itemID":9143,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Coskunsu2015ArchaeologyChildhood"},{"key":"5AHJ2VHT","version":8673,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"29","issue":"4","pages":"602-612","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Osteoarchaeology","ISSN":"1047-482X","date":"2019/07/01","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7438","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/oa.2756","abstractNote":"Abstract The inclusion of faunal remains in funerary practices is widely documented in Iberian prehistory. For the late prehistory (Neolithic to Bronze Age), there is relatively more data than in earlier periods, with limb segments being very common, and complete animals are rarer. In Bronze Age contexts from South-Western Iberia, a high percentage of human burials in subterranean chambers (hypogea) are associated with limb bones of cattle (Bos taurus) and sheep/goats (Ovis/Capra), along with other grave goods. Traditionally, this practice is interpreted as the result of rituals of commensality. In this paper, we present a different perspective. Besides commensality, we show that the inclusion of the same species and the same anatomical parts is a highly standardised behaviour. Beyond the tight connection between humans and animals, this pattern also points to a strong symbolism of these domestic species and to symbolic meaning of the anatomical parts themselves.","title":"The symbolic meaning of cattle and sheep/goat in the Bronze Age: Faunal inclusions in funerary contexts of South-Western Iberia","creators":[{"firstName":"Cláudia","lastName":"Costa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ana M.

Leur originalité repose sur la délimitation de la plupart des tombes par de remarquables couronnes de pierres dont les diamètres varient entre 1 et 10 m. Cette spécificité relève manifestement d’une adaptation locale, les populations ayant su tirer parti des matériaux présents sur place et mettre en œuvre des principes architecturaux jusqu’alors inédits dans la région. A Courcelles, on constate que, si la pratique de l’incinération est bien maîtrisée, l’analyse comparée des deux sites met en exergue la variété des comportements déployés autour de la mort et du traitement du défunt, depuis le bûcher funéraire jusqu’au dépôt dans la tombe. La continuité d’utilisation des deux sites permet ainsi de suivre l’évolution des comportements funéraires sur deux siècles. Enfin, bien que la majorité des défunts soit accompagnée d’un mobilier assez modeste au regard des comparaisons établies avec les ensembles funéraires des vallées de l’Yonne et de la haute Seine, les assemblages étudiés offrent un corpus de référence pour affiner la chronologie régionale et appréhender les composantes culturelles locales.

The application of archaeological 3D data deriving from sources including ALS, close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial and photogrammetric scanners has grown exponentially over the last decade. Such data present numerous possibilities and challenges, from ensuring that applications remain archaeologically relevant, to developing practices that integrate the manipulation and interrogation of complex digital datasets with the skills of archaeological observation and interpretation. This volume addresses the implications of multi-scaled topographic data for contemporary archaeological practice in a rapidly developing field, drawing on examples of ongoing projects and reflections on best practice.Twenty papers from across Europe explore the implications of these digital 3D datasets for the recording and interpretation of archaeological topography, whether at the landscape, site or artefact scale. The papers illustrate the variety of ways in which we engage with archaeological topography through 3D data, from discussions of its role in landscape archaeology, to issues of context and integration, and to the methodological challenges of processing, visualisation and manipulation. Critical reflection on developing practice and implications for cultural resource management and research contextualize the case studies and applications, illustrating the diverse and evolving roles played by multi-scalar topographic data in contemporary archaeology.","title":"Interpreting Archaeological Topography – 3D Data, Visualisation and Observation","creators":[{"firstName":"David C.","lastName":"Cowley","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Rachel S.","lastName":"Opitz","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Prospektion"},{"tag":"Geoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Topografie"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:50:49Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:20:58Z","itemID":7379,"notes":[{"key":"6HR8N848","version":2607,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"9TC47WRE","note":"<p>2012044300<br/>edited by Rachel S.

This paper demonstrates how this can be done with acoustic scale models. Scale modelling is an established method in architectural acoustics, but it has not previously been applied to prehistoric monuments. The Stonehenge model described here allows the acoustics in the Late Neolithic and early Bronze Age to be quantified and the effects on musical sounds and speech to be inferred. It was found that the stone reflections create an average mid-frequency reverberation time of (0.64 ± 0.03) seconds and an amplification of (4.3 ± 0.9) dB for speech. The model has a more accurate representation of the prehistoric geometry, giving a reverberation time that is significantly greater than that measured in the current ruin and a full-size concrete replica at Maryhill, USA. The amplification could have aided speech communication and the reverberation improved musical sounds. How Stonehenge was used is much debated, but these results show that sounds were improved within the circle compared to outside. Stonehenge had different configurations, especially in terms of the positions of the bluestones. However, this made inaudible changes to the acoustics, suggesting sound is unlikely to be the underlying motivation for the various arrangements.","title":"Using scale modelling to assess the prehistoric acoustics of stonehenge","creators":[{"firstName":"Trevor J.","lastName":"Cox","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bruno M.","lastName":"Fazenda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan E.","lastName":"Greaney","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Akustik"},{"tag":"henge monuments"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:24Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:24Z","itemID":11150,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CoxEtAl2020UsingScale"},{"key":"9IW35C4M","version":22182,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01756-w","rights":"2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","pages":"1-13","publicationTitle":"Nature Human Behaviour","ISSN":"2397-3374","date":"2023-12-11","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-023-01756-w","accessDate":"2023-12-13T08:00:08Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"The rules and structure of human culture impact health as much as genetics or environment. To study these relationships, we combine ancient DNA (n = 230), skeletal metrics (n = 391), palaeopathology (n = 606) and dietary stable isotopes (n = 873) to analyse stature variation in Early Neolithic Europeans from North Central, South Central, Balkan and Mediterranean regions. In North Central Europe, stable isotopes and linear enamel hypoplasias indicate high environmental stress across sexes, but female stature is low, despite polygenic scores identical to males, and suggests that cultural factors preferentially supported male recovery from stress. In Mediterranean populations, sexual dimorphism is reduced, indicating male vulnerability to stress and no strong cultural preference for males. Our analysis indicates that biological effects of sex-specific inequities can be linked to cultural influences at least as early as 7,000 yr ago, and culture, more than environment or genetics, drove height disparities in Early Neolithic Europe.","title":"Socio-cultural practices may have affected sex differences in stature in Early Neolithic Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Samantha L.","lastName":"Cox","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicole","lastName":"Nicklisch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Francken","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Wahl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Haak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kurt W.","lastName":"Alt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Rosenstock","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iain","lastName":"Mathieson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithisierung"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Linienbandkeramik"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bandkeramik"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2023-12-13T08:00:08Z","dateModified":"2023-12-13T08:00:08Z","itemID":31584,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CoxEtAl2023SocioculturalPractices"},{"key":"7UBU6FLA","version":3967,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"7","issue":"2","pages":"194-202","publicationTitle":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","date":"2019","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7005","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.4","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge Core","abstractNote":"A major challenge facing archaeologists is communicating our research to the public.

We suggest that these new digital tools serve as an excellent aid for education on the importance of archaeological sites and artifacts. To illustrate the above we walk the reader through a step-by-step pipeline of how to run an ABM model as an experiment and how to export it into a form ready to be sent to SHPO and THPO offices in tandem with reports.

As farming spread on a generally northwest trajectory across Europe, early pastoralists would have been faced with the challenge of making farming viable in regions in which the organisms were poorly adapted to providing optimal yields or even surviving. Hence, it has long been debated whether Neolithic economies were ever established at the modern limits of agriculture. Here, we examine food residues in pottery, testing a hypothesis that Neolithic farming was practiced beyond the 60th parallel north. Our findings, based on diagnostic biomarker lipids and δ13C values of preserved fatty acids, reveal a transition at ca 2500 BC from the exploitation of aquatic organisms to processing of ruminant products, specifically milk, confirming farming was practiced at high latitudes. Combining this with genetic, environmental and archaeological information, we demonstrate the origins of dairying probably accompanied an incoming, genetically distinct, population successfully establishing this new subsistence ‘package’.","title":"Neolithic dairy farming at the extreme of agriculture in northern Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Lucy J.

J. C. Atkinson, taking photographs at Stonehenge, made a most remarkable discovery. He was preparing to photograph a name carved on the inward-facing (northwest) face of Stone 53, one of the Great Horseshoe Trilithons; for this purpose he had remained there after 5 o’clock on July 10th, waiting for the sun to move round and shine on it. Looking not directly at the stone itself but at the image on the glass of his reflex camera, he suddenly saw the dark outline of what appeared to be a dagger, and beside it that of an axe. The carvings were deeply cut and the edges smoothened by the erosive action of more than thirty centuries of British weather (PLATE I). Closer inspection revealed several more axes and some other markings, all probably artificial but now too much weathered for decipherment. Two days later a ten-year-old schoolboy, David Booth, found an axe on the outer face of Stone 4, one of the stones of the Outer Circle, and subsequent search revealed ten more axes on the same face (PLATES II, VI A). Later still, while engaged in making casts of the axes already discovered, Mr R. S. Newall has found many more, bringing the total for Stone 53 up to 12 and for Stone 4 to 25, including on the latter one exceptionally large axe measuring 14 inches in length and 10½ inches across the splayed cutting edge. He has also verified three axes like the others near the bottom left-hand corner of the outer face of Stone 3 (PLATE III B).","title":"The Symbols carved on Stonehenge","creators":[{"firstName":"O.

It investigates early warfare and violence from the standpoint of four broad, interdisciplinary themes: skeletal markers of interpersonal violence; conflict in prehistoric rock-art; the material evidence of Bronze Age warfare and violence; and the birth of armies in the Iron Age and beyond. The scope of the book has a wide-ranging chronological and geographic coverage, from early Neolithic to Late Iron Age and from Western Europe to East Asia. It includes world-renowned sites and artefact collections such as the Tollense Valley Bronze Age battlefield (Germany), the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Tanum (Sweden), and the British Museum collection of bronze weaponry from the late Shang period (China). Additionally original case studies are presented in each section by a diverse international authorship. The study of warfare and violence in prehistoric and pre-literate societies has been at the forefront of archaeological debate since the publication of Keeley's provocative monograph War Before Civilization (Oxford 1996). The problem has been approached from a number of standpoints including anthropological and behavioral studies of interpersonal violence, osteological examinations of sharp lesions and blunt-force traumas, wear analysis of ancient weaponry, and field experiments with replica weapons and armor. This research, however, is often confined within the boundaries of the various disciplines and specialist fields. In particular, a deep gulf still divides research approaches grounded in the humanities and social sciences from those based on the scientific analysis of human remains and material culture. The consequence is that, to this day, the subject is dominated by a number of undemonstrated assumptions regarding the nature of warfare, combat and violence in non-literate societies as well as the lack of functionality (or effectiveness) of early bronze weaponry and armor. Moreover, important methodological questions remain unanswered: can we securely distinguish between violence-related and accidental trauma on skeletal remains? To what extent can wear analysis shed light on long-forgotten fighting styles? Can we design meaningful combat tests based on historic martial arts? And can the study of rock-art unlock the social realities of prehistoric warfare? By breaking the mold of entrenched subject boundaries, this edited volume promotes interdisciplinary debate in the study of prehistoric warfare and violence by presenting a number of innovative approaches that integrate qualitative and quantitative methods of research and analysis","title":"Prehistoric Warfare and Violence.

The model assumes that per-capita fitness is a combination of the beneficial effect derived from the presence of other individuals in the same group and the finite amount of resource available locally. The former can lead to a positive frequency dependence, whereby an increase in the group size determines an increase in fitness; the latter can have detrimental effects once a group exceeds a certain size and the energetic demand becomes larger than what is available. Given that: (1) individuals have the possibility to modify their condition through group fission and fusion; and (2) the amount of resource is unlikely to be constant over space and time; we can expect fluctuations in the settlement pattern as a function of a non-linear relationship between size and fitness, as well as internally or externally induced variations in the amount of available resources. The simulation model will examine these scenarios and identify how different variables can induce different types of long-term equilibria in settlement systems.","title":"Modelling Settlement Rank-Size Fluctuations","creators":[{"firstName":"Enrico R.","lastName":"Crema","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Wurzer","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Kerstin","lastName":"Kowarik","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Reschreiter","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"GIS"},{"tag":"Siedlungsmodell"},{"tag":"Modellierung"},{"tag":"siedlungsprozesse"},{"tag":"Siedlungsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Simulation"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"_tag_nachtragen"},{"tag":"Benchmark Model","type":1},{"tag":"Intrinsic Growth Rate","type":1},{"tag":"Primate System","type":1},{"tag":"Resource Input","type":1},{"tag":"Spatial Range","type":1},{"tag":"Siedlungsprozesse"}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-29T05:32:43Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:55:25Z","itemID":31342,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Crema2015ModellingSettlement","publicationTitle":"Agent-based Modeling and Simulation in Archaeology"},{"key":"JIQP9WP4","version":28338,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/inference-from-large-sets-of-radiocarbon-dates-software-and-methods/DE7B3B8298D6086AEBFE306C714E44BC","volume":"63","issue":"1","pages":"23-39","publicationTitle":"Radiocarbon","ISSN":"0033-8222, 1945-5755","date":"2021/02","DOI":"10.1017/RDC.2020.95","accessDate":"2022-06-27T06:19:01Z","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge University Press","abstractNote":"The last decade has seen the development of a range of new statistical and computational techniques for analysing large collections of radiocarbon (14C) dates, often but not exclusively to make inferences about human population change in the past.

Here we follow this research agenda and present a novel approach based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which enables the evaluation of multiple competing evolutionary models formulated as computer simulations. This approach offers the opportunity to: 1) flexibly integrate archaeological biases derived from sampling and time averaging; 2) estimate model parameters in a probabilistic fashion, taking into account both prior knowledge and empirical data; and 3) shift from an hypothesis-testing to a model selection approach. We applied ABC to a chronologically fine-grained Western European Neolithic armature assemblage, comparing three possible candidate models of evolutionary change: 1) unbiased transmission; 2) conformist bias; and 3) anti-conformist bias. Results showed that unbiased and anti-conformist transmission models provide equally good explanatory models for the observed data, suggesting high levels of equifinality. We also examined whether the appearance of the Bell Beaker culture was correlated with marked changes in the frequency of different armature types. Comparisons between the empirical data and expectations generated from the simulation model did not show any evidence in support of this hypothesis and instead indicated lower than expected dissimilarity between assemblages dated before and after the emergence of the Bell Beaker culture.","title":"An Approximate Bayesian Computation approach for inferring patterns of cultural evolutionary change","creators":[{"firstName":"E.

This complex monument, comprising two super-imposed tanks, is generally linked with an important but uncertain ritual role involving water. The context provides extraordinary preservation of both wooden, other organic, and cultural finds. The key question until now, hindering further interpretation of this remarkable structure, has been the precise date of the tanks. Initial work pointed to use of the two tanks over about a century. Using dendrochronology and radiocarbon ‘wiggle-matching’ we report near-absolute construction dates for both of the tanks. The lower (older) tank is dated ~1444±4 BCE and the upper (more recent) tank is dated 12 years later at ~1432±4 BCE. This dating of the construction of the Noceto tanks in the 3rd quarter of the 15th century BCE further enables us to reassess the overall period of activity of this wooden complex and its association with a major period of societal change in the Bronze Age of northern Italy starting in the later 15th century BCE.","title":"Dating the Noceto Vasca Votiva, a unique wooden structure of the 15th century BCE, and the timing of a major societal change in the Bronze Age of northern Italy","creators":[{"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Cremaschi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carol","lastName":"Griggs","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Kocik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Mutti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Zerboni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sturt W.","lastName":"Manning","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Brunnen"},{"tag":"Italien"},{"tag":"Opfer"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"},{"tag":"Dendrochronologie"},{"tag":"Wasser"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-14T08:22:12Z","dateModified":"2021-06-14T08:22:12Z","itemID":11608,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CremaschiEtAl2021DatingNoceto"},{"key":"8NIIM67C","version":2253,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"LXXXI","pages":"55-84","publicationTitle":"BSAA Arqueología","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6384","title":"Prospección magnética en el recinto de fosos calcolítico de “El Casetón de la Era” (Villalba de los Alcores, Valladolid): Representación gráfica e interpretación arqueológica","creators":[{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Crespo Díez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José Antonio","lastName":"Rodríguez Marcos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Germán","lastName":"Delibes de Castro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Becker","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Rondell"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Befestigung"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Kreisgrabenanlage"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Südwesteuropa"},{"tag":"Portugal"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:57:54Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:57:54Z","itemID":9427,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CrespoDiezEtAl2015ProspeccionMagnetica"},{"key":"NXS7CV69","version":3776,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Archaeolingua Main Series","place":"Budapest","pages":"169-178","date":"2001","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_254","seriesNumber":"13","title":"Forms of Ceremonial Landscapes in Iberia from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.
