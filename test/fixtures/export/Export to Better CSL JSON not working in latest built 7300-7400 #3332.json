Das Ziel dieses Bandes besteht darin, eine Brücke zu vormodernen, so genannten elementaren, vernakulären oder traditionellen Architekturen zu schlagen. Dabei liegt der Fokus insbesondere auf Wohngebäuden und Siedlungskonfigurationen, durch die das Alltagsleben und die Sozialstrukturen am stärksten geprägt und repräsentiert werden. Auf dem Gebiet der Wohnarchitektur besteht großer Forschungsbedarf, da den Prestige- und Monumentalbauten bisher überproportional viel Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet wurde. Erst die gemeinsame Betrachtung von Palästen und Armenvierteln, von Tempelanlagen und Wohnhütten ermöglicht aber einen angemessenen Zugang zur sozialen (Um-)Welt vergangener und gegenwärtiger Kulturen.\nDas Buch, zu dem Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler aus Architektursoziologie, Ur- und Frühgeschichte, Mittelalterarchäologie und Ethnologie beigetragen haben, liefert eine breite Palette transdisziplinärer, kulturvergleichender, theoretisch fundierter und empirisch abgesicherter Aufsätze zu einem neuen Forschungsfeld.","title":"Der gebaute Raum.

This article presents three different grouping approaches, each originally developed independently, and applied to a common dataset of archaeological finds. The aim is not to search for the right approach or results, in a competing way, but rather to present the methods as complementary. It is also our intention to stress that a tight connection between theory and statistical modelling is indispensable. Indeed, the use of a particular methodology must be supported by an adapted theory; similarly, a theory without a proper methodological realisation will often not have any actual utility. The integration of theory and method is exemplified in the three case methods. The first method uses metal objects as cultural indicators. The study area is divided into a set of identical geographical units, characterized according to the type and proportions of indicators and grouped using hierarchical clustering. The second approach deals with cultures as standardisations between individuals, using ‘Typenspektrum’ as significant data for identifying different cultures. Groups are defined through kernel density estimation and a cluster analysis, followed by internal and external validation techniques. A third method characterizes the funerary ritual and grave-goods, using a similarity algorithm coupled with clustering procedures to compare the graves with one another. The outcome is validated with exploratory methods and compared to patterns from different contexts. The complementarity of the results shows that each approach sheds light on a certain facet of the same whole.","title":"Three Methods for Detecting Past Groupings: Cultural Space and Group Identity","creators":[{"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Tremblay Cormier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Nakoinz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cătălin Nicolae","lastName":"Popa","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"GIS"},{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"Soziale Identität"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:58Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:58Z","itemID":10902,"notes":[],"citationKey":"TremblayCormierEtAl2018ThreeMethods"},{"key":"NMMDN88M","version":2308,"itemType":"book","series":"BAR Int.

It was established that the flesh-hook was cast from arsenical bronze with the use of the lost wax method and was used to take meat out of a cauldron and, therefore, it entered a ceremonial table-ware set used in public feasts. the depicted pair of naked men in boxing stand (fig. 2; 3) represents a scene of ritual fight in the presence of or in honor of a deity whose attribute are bull horns (fig. 4), on which fighters are standing. As a whole, the item is associated with the theme of a funeral feast and funeral games. the narrative scene and iconography of the images are likely to have its roots in the canons of Sumerian temple art of the early Dynastic period and, probably, even of the earlier time (fig. 5). the adaptation of this narrative to the Maikop cultural milieu is explained by its attribution to the circle of cultures located in the northernmost periphery of the western Asia civilization. two figures depicted on the tsarskaya fleshhook represent the earliest example of anthropomorphic portable art in the caucasus and the earliest sculptural image of fist fighting in the world.","title":"Крюк с изображением сцены кулачного поединка из дольмена майкопской культуры, станица Царская, Северо-Западный Кавказ (The Flesh-Hook Featuring a Scene of Fist Fighting from a Maikop culture Dolmen near the Village of Tsarskaya in the Northwest Caucasus)","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"Трифонов В.

Te present study deals with the question of phenotypic alterations in Alpine sheep during these 4500 years of prehistoric Alpine livestock farming. It furthermore addresses the issue of to what extent morphological developments were triggered by processes of economic, cultural or ecological change. o answer these questions, bone measurements of sheep from 59 ﬁnd complexes in an Alpine model region were examined. Te region stretches between the Northern Pre-Alps and the Padanian Plain and comprises the valleys of Inn, Isarco and Adige along with adjacent regions. As shown by the application of logarithmic size index analyses and withers height calculations, the phenotypic development of sheep was characterised by micro-regional diﬀerences; for example, while the Inn Valley population underwent a size reduction from the Late Bronze Age onwards, the conspeciﬁcs of the southern Alpine fringe grew synchronously larger. For other regions, no diachronic changes were observed. Based on the osteometric analysis, the following factors are discussed as potential triggers for phenotypic alterations in Alpine livestock: climatic ﬂuctuations, a physical adaptation to high altitude pasturing, the emergence of wool farming, the introduction of allochthonous livestock in the context of cultural transfer and shifts in the sex ratios caused by changing exploitation patterns. In order to evaluate the possible inﬂuence of these aspects on sheep morphology, the osteometric results are compared to diﬀerent data on the cultural and climatic development of the Alpine region.","title":"The biometry of prehistoric Alpine sheep: exploring four millennia of human-sheep interaction by means of osteometry","shortTitle":"The biometry of prehistoric Alpine sheep","creators":[{"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Trixl","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Tierhaltung"},{"tag":"Alpenraum"}],"dateAdded":"2023-10-05T06:36:20Z","dateModified":"2023-10-05T06:39:16Z","itemID":31357,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Trixl2022BiometryPrehistoric"},{"key":"MS5CB26M","version":20930,"itemType":"presentation","place":"Innsbruck","date":"2023-09-28","meetingName":"Die Alpen im 1.

However, due to post-depositional alteration, sherds that were not originally coated with a slip may macroscopically appear with deceptively similar pale surfaces. This paper presents a comparison of two sherds, both with pale to white surfaces, one of which is a real slip and the other a surficial corrosion that occurred during the burial stage. Observations using optical and scanning electron microscopy, as well as electron-probe image- and microanalysis, clearly illustrate the features of the two surfaces, as well as demonstrating their causes and effects. The superimposed slip is clearly delimited from the sherd body by a denser and much finer-grained fabric, in which clay minerals predominate and porosity is reduced by about 20% compared to the body. In the other sample, surface corrosion, due to invading fluids, has led to leaching of calcareous constituents and results in a remarkable increase in porosity close to the rim (ca. 25%). Sometimes called the “espresso crema effect” (Tschegg et al., 2009b), the surface becomes considerably brighter than the core and can easily be confused with intentional slips. This, as a consequence can lead to significant misinterpretations, to erroneous sherd characterizations and classifications, as well as to incorrect assignments to specific ware groups.","title":"Post-depositional surface whitening of ceramic artifacts: alteration mechanisms and consequences","creators":[{"firstName":"Cornelius","lastName":"Tschegg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Keramik"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:40:45Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:40:45Z","itemID":4559,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Tschegg2009PostdepositionalSurface"},{"key":"LYFVFVAU","version":9248,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"2016","pages":"33-35","publicationTitle":"Arch.

It involved fallow periods, where the arable land is left without crops in order to let it recover its fertility for several years while becoming grassland. This led to regeneration of the topsoil humus, which could later be mobilized by cultivation. With later farming systems, the supply of nutrients needed for crops could also be provided by manuring, which allowed shorter fallow periods but required the production of manure. Such cultivation systems with short or even without fallow phases and with intensive manuring are known from the medieval period as one, two or three field systems of agriculture and their development was an important step towards the intensification of farming. The current study considers on-site plant macrofossil data from archaeological sites as well as the off-site pollen data from cores in Baden-Württemberg in order to recognize the main changes towards agricultural intensification through time from the Bronze Age up to medieval times. The various landscape types included in the study area also reveal their different agricultural histories of intensification. In lowlands with good soils, the intensification can be recognized earlier and more strongly than in uplands or other marginal areas. The main shift towards intensification took place in the Roman period, which is also confirmed by written sources of the time that mention manuring as well as a kind of two field system and alternation between grassland and arable land.","title":"Intensification of agriculture in southwestern Germany between the Bronze Age and Medieval period, based on archaeobotanical data from Baden-Württemberg","creators":[{"firstName":"Gegeensuvd","lastName":"Tserendorj","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Marinova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jutta","lastName":"Lechterbeck","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Behling","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lucia","lastName":"Wick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elske","lastName":"Fischer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Sillmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tanja","lastName":"Märkle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Rösch","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Ackerbau"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Hsdlg_FbzMbz"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Landschaftsentwicklung"},{"tag":"Agrargeschichte"},{"tag":"Pollenanalyse"},{"tag":"Agrarlandschaft"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-13T15:32:07Z","dateModified":"2023-09-13T15:36:04Z","itemID":31314,"notes":[],"citationKey":"TserendorjEtAl2021IntensificationAgriculture"},{"key":"FR2P5BW2","version":19645,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/from-typology-and-biography-to-multiplicity-bracers-as-process-objects/F292847D5A4DF3A9F0FE37AC6FBB14E8","pages":"1-22","publicationTitle":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","ISSN":"0959-7743, 1474-0540","date":"2023/05/11","DOI":"10.1017/S0959774323000094","accessDate":"2023-06-05T14:11:30Z","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge University Press","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this article we put forward an alternative account of the famous wristguards, or bracers, of the European Early Bronze Age.

Using lithological and geochemical methods, soil profiles from the barrow and its surroundings were analyzed, as well as the post-depositional processes that transformed the mound and grave pit of a Yamnaya culture barrow dating back to the Early Bronze Age. The effects of mechanical denudation of the barrows were observed. Despite organic matter having originally constituted a considerable proportion of the barrow mound, its loss is evident, mainly as a result of accelerated mineralization. Moreover, the distribution of geochemical components within a barrow depends on the original distribution of organic matter in the barrow mound and its transformation by animals. Barrow and grave pit structures were examined, and intervention rituals were reconstructed. A bed of sand (lithologically distinct) was found on the floor of the grave pit. This may have underlain the mat on which the body was placed. Higher phosphorus and iron contents confirmed the presence of burials and ochres in the grave pit.","title":"Geochemical, lithological and archaeological studies on an Early Bronze Age barrow destroyed by modern tillage in Petrove, central Ukraine","creators":[{"firstName":"Mykola","lastName":"Tupchiienko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iwona","lastName":"Hildebrandt-Radke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Waldemar","lastName":"Spychalski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vitalii","lastName":"Rud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yulia","lastName":"Ushkova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Przemysław","lastName":"Makarowicz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Osteuropa"},{"tag":"Ukraine"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Hügelkonstruktion"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Grabhügel_Wunnenstein"},{"tag":"Post-depositional processes"}],"dateAdded":"2023-11-27T08:08:01Z","dateModified":"2023-11-27T08:08:45Z","itemID":31524,"notes":[],"citationKey":"TupchiienkoEtAl2023GeochemicalLithological"},{"key":"KXLPPS8R","version":2104,"itemType":"book","series":"Bibliotheca Arch.

Jahrtausend v.Chr. eine enorme wirtschaftliche Bedeutung, da alpines Kupfer für die Metallversorgung Europas eine zentrale Rolle spielte. Der vorliegende Band resümiert den aktuellen Forschungsstand zur prähistorischen alpinen Kupfergewinnung von den Westalpen und Südalpen bis vor die Tore Wiens in den Ostalpen. Die 23 Beiträge hervorgegangen aus einer im September 2016 veranstalteten Tagung an der Universität Innsbruck umfassen die Themen Montanlandschaft, Bergbau, Aufbereitung, Verhüttung und Metallhandel in der Bronzezeit und frühen Eisenzeit. Ein zentrales Forschungsunternehmen kommt im vorliegenden Band in besonderer Weise zu Wort, nämlich das 2014 bis 2018 von Partnern in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz durchgeführte D-A-CH-Projekt „Prehistoric copper production in the Eastern and Central Alps technical, social and economic dynamics in space and time“. Die Autor*innen des Bandes stellen die Fahlerzproblematik und die verschiedenen technischen Prozesse im Rahmen einer allgemeineren „chaîne opératoire“ in ein neues Licht. In Umrissen lässt sich schon heute erkennen, wie unterschiedlich einzelne alpinen Regionen allgemeinere technische und wirtschaftliche Konzepte rund um die Kupfergewinnung adaptiert haben.","title":"Alpine Copper II – Alpenkupfer II – Rame delle Alpi II – Cuivre des Alpes II.

Two very similar dwelling structures were discov-ered by Ivana Pleinerová at Březnoin in Northwest Bohemia and another yet unpublished example  was recovered at Milan Zápotocký’s excavations at Kozly (Mělník district). In Central Europe, there is only a limited number of similar examples from Poland, the Saale Region and Lower Saxony  but overall numerous examples of FBC houses are known.

Weapons were presented during funerary ceremonials, as well as in the world of the living as symbolical attributes of power and prestige. Such signifying artefacts were also used during the ceremonial warfare contests in order to emphasise male strength,  ghting skills and accuracy and to reinforce the position of individual contestants within the community. The prestigious weapons were also depicted on  gural grave stones and in open-air rock art. Archery became decisively important in the symbolic expression of warfare during the Bell Beaker period and it is commonly demonstrated within the burial customs.\nTechnology, metrics, raw materials and their colours are discussed in this paper together with the gender-signifying role of archery package.\nWe are going to observe how archery and its symbolism played an important role amongst prehistoric societies not only as a hunting method, but mainly as warfare phenomenon. In different cultures of the World archery shooting contests were carried out as a part of ceremonial warfare. Archery presentation also became an important feature of cosmology.","title":"Bell Beaker stone wrist-guards as symbolic male ornament.

There is no solid evidence for the funerary function of long houses, however, it is commonly assumed (Bradley 2001). Already during their dwelling function some houses were possibly used for primary deposition of remains of ancestors. The burials were later in the time of abandonment of the house removed elsewhere or remained resting inside the building. This is the process of transformation from the house of living to the house of dead. The main purpose of the second part of the paper is to discuss the question on missing evidence of barrows of the late Eneolithic Corded Ware and Bell Beaker period in Central Europe. Variety of problems of demographic representation of cemeteries, burial customs and spatial structure of funerary areas are connected to the missing barrows. I emphasise the variability of late Eneolithic funerary monuments, including the discussion on burial chambers and circular ditches, yet another type of funerary construction without an earthed mound that may be described as houses of dead.","title":"Houses of living and houses of dead in the Neolithic and Copper Age of Central Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Totenhütte"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:55:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:55:55Z","itemID":9103,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Turek2016HousesLiving"},{"key":"M2VQ8H8U","version":27212,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://juniperpublishers.com/gjaa/GJAA.MS.ID.555559.php","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationTitle":"Global Journal of Archaeology & Anthropology","ISSN":"25758608","date":"2017-3-27","journalAbbreviation":"GJAA","DOI":"10.19080/GJAA.2017.01.555559","accessDate":"2023-12-05T09:10:38Z","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Enclosures in Human Mind","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Spätneolithikum"},{"tag":"Erdwerk"},{"tag":"Grabenwerk"}],"dateAdded":"2023-12-05T09:10:38Z","dateModified":"2025-02-26T20:10:36Z","itemID":31557,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Turek2017EnclosuresHuman"},{"key":"XMYWVG55","version":7977,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"13","issue":"3","pages":"535-548","publicationTitle":"Archaeologies","ISSN":"1935-3987","date":"2017/12/01","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6688","DOI":"10.1007/s11759-017-9330-x","abstractNote":"Sadly, aggression is still one of the most common features of human behaviour; it is an instinct to promote and survive our own genes against the genes of others. Human intraspecific aggression has gradually become part of human culture over the last 40,000 years and has been institutionalized in various forms of social activities. Particularly in the post-glacial period, the level of social relations has developed dramatically in the context of population growth and the growth of human communities. In the time of Neolithic and Chalcolithic European agricultural populations, the motive of control over farming land became highly important. Also the control of main means of production and social power was increasingly maintaining the intragroup competition and aggression. Thus, violence was employed within the community in order to obtain and maintain individual or collective social status, but also against other communities in an effort to protect property and territory. Particularly the intracommunity aggression was soon transformed into variety of different formal ways of symbolic fighting, which usually did not lead to the unwanted death of a defeated member of the community. The symbolic struggle between members of the community as well as the defense against external aggression were gradually formalized in the form of introduction of specialized weapons designed for combat between people and creation of fortifications.

Brewing and beer consumption have played a significant role in prehistoric human cultures around the world. Beer was a tasty, nutritious food, a substance affecting the mind, medicine, a religious symbol, as well as a social medium and an accelerator. Alcohol relieved the pain and prevented the spread of infection. Beer was a safe and healthy drink compared to contaminated water. At the time when our ancestors began to domesticate agricultural crops, they commonly produced not only bread but also beer. It is probable that the first ceramic vessels in the Near East were created precisely out of the need to more effectively control the technological process of beer production. Similarly, in the Central European Copper Age, beer production and its growing social significance influenced the emergence of the set Ceramic complex that lasted continuously for more than three millennia. Beer has entered almost all aspects of social life, from everyday consumption and social interactions to initiation ceremonies and major religious celebrations. The study of beer and other fermented beverages sheds light on many aspects of the biocultural development of humans on this planet.","title":"Beer, Pottery, Society and Early European Identity","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Bier"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:23Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:23Z","itemID":11136,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Turek2020BeerPottery"},{"key":"RR3KC426","version":15620,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2020-0207/html","volume":"7","issue":"1","pages":"1674-1684","publicationTitle":"Open Archaeology","ISSN":"2300-6560","date":"2021-01-01","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2020-0207","accessDate":"2022-08-29T07:43:28Z","libraryCatalog":"www.degruyter.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"Based on reconstruction of the spatial context of causewayed enclosures and long barrows of the Proto- and Early Eneolithic period, we attempt to model the phenomenon of the ritual landscape in Central and North Bohemia. Discussing the purpose and meaning of the long barrows and enclosures, they are being described as funerary and religious structures related to the cult of ancestors. An alternative explanation views them primarily, in economic terms, as territorial markers delineating the areas controlled by different communities. It seems likely that both of these interpretations are valid and well characterise the true nature of such structures. Both types of monuments should not be perceived as isolated structures, but just the opposite as they are part of a pattern of regional and super-regional identity of communities and individuals. In fact, they are crucial elements of the overall system of structuring of the prehistoric landscape.","title":"Neolithic Long Barrows and Enclosures as Landmarks of Ritual Landscape of Central and North Bohemia","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"Grabenwerk"},{"tag":"Langhügel"},{"tag":"causewayed enclosures"},{"tag":"rituelle Landschaft"},{"tag":"Pseudomegalithik"}],"dateAdded":"2022-08-29T07:43:29Z","dateModified":"2022-08-29T07:43:29Z","itemID":16837,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Turek2021NeolithicLong"},{"key":"4293EZA9","version":15608,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11759-022-09450-5","publicationTitle":"Archaeologies","ISSN":"1935-3987","date":"2022-07-29","journalAbbreviation":"Arch","DOI":"10.1007/s11759-022-09450-5","accessDate":"2022-08-29T07:38:48Z","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","language":"en","abstractNote":"After development over two millennia of Neolithic monumental architecture (enclosures & long barrows) in Central Europe, the 3rd Millennium BC seems to bring a hiatus in the creation of such monuments. The cult and worship moved to natural shrines (Corded Ware) and became invisible in the archaeological record. However, in the last decade, some new forms of Bell Beaker ritual constructions were discovered in Bohemia and Moravia. Two such features were discovered during large scale excavations at Hostivice, west of Prague in 2011 and 2013. The first consisted of a rectangular setting of large postholes with a large internal pit containing scatters of cremated (animal?) bones and fragments of decorated beakers. The second structure consisted of large circular postholes surrounding a pit which contained a votive offering of four stone wristguards carefully set in a square arrangement. In 2015, unprecedented evidence of a Bell Beaker ritual site was discovered at Brodek in Central Moravia. An unusual long rectangular passage structure defined by alignments of postholes and a ‘shrine’ consisting of four grave-like pits containing a variety of votive offerings, but no visible indications of human burial, were discovered. The sacrificial deposits were probably inserted into the features during a series of successive offering events. These previously unknown types of monument suggest a greater complexity of funerary and ritual construction in the region of non-megalithic territory.","title":"From Long Barrows to Ancestral Shrines: Bell Beaker Monuments and Cosmology in Central Europe","shortTitle":"From Long Barrows to Ancestral Shrines","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Heiligtum"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Tschechien"}],"dateAdded":"2022-08-29T07:38:49Z","dateModified":"2022-08-29T07:38:49Z","itemID":16838,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Turek2022LongBarrows"},{"key":"YJBTF6H2","version":27198,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.arub.cz/wp-content/uploads/PV-64_1_05_fin.pdf","volume":"64","issue":"1","pages":"77-83","publicationTitle":"Přehled výzkumů","ISSN":"2571-0605, 1211-7250","date":"2023-6-30","journalAbbreviation":"PV","DOI":"10.47382/pv0641-08","accessDate":"2023-07-19T07:29:21Z","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","abstractNote":"Although multiple burial contexts are uncommon, they are a typical feature of Corded Ware funerary behaviour. This paper focuses on various aspects of Corded Ware multiple burials in Bohemia and the adjacent regions of Central Europe. Particular attention is given to the occurrence of burials in the antipode position and the age, gender and possible familial relationship of the individuals in such graves. A unique example of multiple burials is the biritual Grave 1/95 in Slaný (Kladno District) in Bohemia, which contained a minimum of seven individuals (men, women and children), four of which\nwere cremated. Despite the exceptional use of the cremation method of burial, the Slaný grave fits the well-defined collective type of Corded Ware burials usually known from Bohemia, such as in Třebusice (Kladno District); Bylany (Kolín District); Chrášťany (Prague-west District). Similar, but not identical collective burials are known from Obrnice (Most District) and Určice (Prostějov District) in Moravia and Święte, site 20 (Grave 43) in\nLittle Poland. Similar examples are also known from Saxony-Anhalt in the case of the Eulau collective burial. It appears these communal burials represent a particular variety of funerary practices (ritual) rather than evidence of a specific event. New archaeogenetic data may shed more light on the questions of whether these burials represent a nuclear family, what can we learn about the familial ties and the meaning of a collective funerary event. Some cases (Eulau) presume the multiple burials as a result of a violent occurrence (conflict or sacrifice) while others may be the result of disease or the special status of particular members of the community.","title":"The social meaning of multiple burials in the Corded Ware culture","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Mähren"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Mehrfachbestattung"},{"tag":"Bestattungssitten"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2023-07-19T07:29:21Z","dateModified":"2025-02-26T20:10:26Z","itemID":31196,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Turek2023SocialMeaning"},{"key":"34UBRH3W","version":2066,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"BAR Int.

This new analysis, resulting from a threeyear interdisciplinary research project, of the phenomenon of Neolithic long barrows in Bohemia and Central Europe presents entirely new findings and data and tackles a number of previously unresolved questions. New discoveries, based primarily on remote sensing and targeted excavations, together with the revision of earlier archaeological records, allow us to define more accurately the construction and chronological development of these monuments, and to advance our knowledge of the southeastern boundary of this phenomenon's spread together with reconstruction of the social and religious significance of these monuments for the agricultural communities of Central Europe.\n\nAt the sacred places defined by the long barrows, ceremonies and rituals took place over millennia that confirmed the cohesion of the living with the ancestors and their faith in the gods. People, even many generations later, continued to venerate these ancient monuments, not as places of final rest for their direct ancestors but as places dedicated to mythical time, where the living meet the dead and honour the gods. It is not surprising, therefore, that people added the burials of their own ancestors to the embankments of ancient barrows and established their own funerary areas nearby even after several millennia.\n\nAll long barrows excavated within our project contained only one primary burial: in Bohemia these were not collective graves as found, for example, in the British Isles or Scandinavia. Given the monumentality of barrow construction, it can be presumed that the buried individuals represented a form of social elite, though not necessarily due to their individual social power. It seems that the primary burial played the role of an initiation sacrifice: a ritual of consecration of the ancestor sanctuary, which then no longer served for further burials that may have been taboo. Subsequent activities may have been related to forms of ancestral cult, but the primary burial was not followed by other funerary events. All evidence of later burials is at least 1000 years later than barrow construction.\n\nIn the region around the Czech mythical Mountain Říp, burial monuments from various prehistoric periods, including the Late Neolithic, abound. Residential and economic activities on the plains appear later. It can be assumed that this area was perceived as a ritual landscape in earlier prehistory in which long barrows played a significant role in structuring the farming landscape and as significant landmarks. Their monumentality initiated a longstanding tradition creating palimpsests of funerary and sacred sites near Mount Říp. The places where the long barrows were built played an important role in the lives of prehistoric communities, and their placement and orientation in the landscape was not random, indicating significant symbolic connotations with the surrounding landscape. The rituals and festivities held here allowed people to connect with the spiritual legacy of their ancestors, thus creating a significant spiritual tradition inscribed in the agriculturally colonised landscape.","title":"The tombs of forefathers: neolithic long barrows in ritual landscapes","shortTitle":"The tombs of forefathers","numPages":"196","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Krištuf","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"Langbett"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Langhügel"}],"dateAdded":"2025-09-05T06:47:04Z","dateModified":"2025-09-05T06:50:36Z","itemID":33389,"notes":[],"citationKey":"TurekKristuf2025TombsForefathers"},{"key":"7Q46KIEV","version":2077,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Trento","pages":"411-428","date":"2001","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4295","title":"Bell Beaker Settlement Pattern in Bohemia and Moravia","creators":[{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Peška","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"F.","lastName":"Nicolis","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Mähren"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"Spätkupferzeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:45:55Z","itemID":5829,"notes":[],"citationKey":"TurekPeska2001BellBeaker","publicationTitle":"Bell Beakers Today.

The economies in these two settings were able to both support complex societies, albeit of very different characters.

Here, towards the end of the second century bc, settlements of the Przeworsk culture appear that provide evidence of a process of migration into a limited ‘cultural island’. In this archaeological context we have used large-scale magnetic mapping and electrical resistivity tomography to determine localities where subsequently archaeological excavations were carried out. Magnetic prospecting has been performed with a multisensor gradiometer array mounted on a cart. Using a newly developed multichannel data logger LEA-D2 supporting a GPS unit for accurate real-time positioning, high-resolution measurements with a rate of more than 1 ha h−1 became possible. Electrical resistivity tomography has been carried out over selected sites to gain additional information on the subsurface from a different perspective.
