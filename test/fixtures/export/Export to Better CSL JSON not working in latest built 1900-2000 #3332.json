The paper reports on a data set of child deposition from Scandinavia in the first millennium CE, and compares the practices with cases from other Germanic areas. While a complex phenomenon where cause of death is mostly unknown, textual sources indicate that neither limited emotional responses to child loss nor infanticide was uncommon in the first millennium CE. Infanticide is widespread cross-culturally, yet is foreign to many researchers because it counters deep-held contemporary, Western perceptions of universal maternal instinct. The paper questions whether infant loss within Scandinavian and Germanic societies prompted emotional responses akin to Western, contemporary reactions. Were infants more closely related to animate objects than human beings? And did this ontological logic provoke the use of infant remains in ritual deposition?","title":"Don’t all mothers love their children?

Contributions employ both traditional inter- or multi-disciplinarian perspectives such as using historical sources, Icelandic sagas and Eddic poetry and also specialised methodologies and/or empirical studies, place-name research, the history of religion and technological advancements, such as isotope analysis. Together these generate new insights into the technology, social organisation and mentality of the worlds of the Vikings.\n\nGeographically, contributions range from Iceland through Scandinavia to the Continent. Scandinavian, British and Continental Viking scholars come together to challenge established truths, present new definitions and discuss old themes from new angles. Topics discussed include personal and communal identity; gender relations between people, artefacts, and places/spaces; rules and regulations within different social arenas; processes of production, trade and exchange, and transmission of knowledge within both past Viking-age societies and present-day research. Displaying thematic breadth as well as geographic and academic diversity, the articles may foreshadow up-and-coming themes for Viking Age research. Rooted in different traditions, using diverse methods and exploring eclectic material – Viking Worlds will provide the reader with a sense of current and forthcoming issues, debates and topics in Viking studies, and give insight into a new generation of ideas and approaches which will mark the years to come.","title":"Viking Worlds: Things, Spaces and Movement","creators":[{"firstName":"Marianne Hem","lastName":"Eriksen","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Unn","lastName":"Pedersen","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Rundberget","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Irmelin","lastName":"Axelsen","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Heidi Lund","lastName":"Berg","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühmittelalter"},{"tag":"Wikingerzeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:56Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:26:57Z","itemID":8232,"notes":[{"key":"GKFQ3VYZ","version":2647,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"L6RXU64P","note":"<p>Table of Contents</p><p>1.

It is well established that they are found across Europe and beyond, and that many were widely circulated over many generations. Yet, few researchers have attempted to discuss the entirety of the flint dagger phenomenon. The present volume brings together papers that address questions of the regional variability and socio-technical complexity of flint daggers and their production. It focuses on the typology, chronology, technology, functionality and meaning of flint and other lithic daggers produced primarily in Europe, but also in the Eastern Mediterranean and East Asia, in prehistory. The 14 papers by leading researchers provide a comprehensive overview of the state of knowledge concerning various flint dagger corpora as well as potential avenues for the development of a research agenda across national, regional and disciplinary boundaries. The volume originates from a session held at the 2011 meeting of the European Association of Archaeology but includes additional commissioned contributions.","title":"Flint Daggers in Prehistoric Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Berit Valentin","lastName":"Eriksen","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Frieman","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Silex"},{"tag":"Waffen"},{"tag":"Silexdolch"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:56Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:26:46Z","itemID":8875,"notes":[{"key":"9EDQQATN","version":2681,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"HHXW7PCJ","note":"<p>Table of Contents</p><p>Contents<br/>1.\tForeword<br/>2.\tIntroduction.

A sampling strategy and analytical approach for stable carbon and nitrogen analysis of bone and dentine collagen optimised for intra-individual purposes is put forward. The rationale behind this strategy, various requirements and constrains, and recommendations on how to modify it according to variations in material and analytical instrumentation, are discussed and explained in detail. Based on intra-individual data for 131 human individuals from Mesolithic and Neolithic sites in Northern Europe, we consider the sources and various kinds of variation one is likely to find, and how the data can be explained and transformed into an archaeologically meaningful interpretation. It is concluded that the use of stable isotope analysis to trace individual life history is not limited to carefully excavated, neatly preserved, single burials with articulate skeletal remains. Even collective burials, disturbed graves, disarticulated human remains in cultural layers, or other depositions that deviate from what is often considered as a “proper burial”, offer the possibility to look at individual life biographies.","title":"Dietary life histories in Stone Age Northern Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Gunilla","lastName":"Eriksson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kerstin","lastName":"Lidén","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mesolithikum"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Migration"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:48:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:48:53Z","itemID":6758,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ErikssonLidenDietaryLife"},{"key":"N3AC9QJN","version":8583,"itemType":"book","series":"Pam.

If we consider the Mesolithic people of North Africa (Taforalt, Maroc) and Ukraine (Vasiliyevka II and III. ; Vovnigi II) as precursors of cranial surgery, the first Danubian (Vedrovice, Moravie) and Mediterranean Neolithic people (abri Pendimoun, Castellar, Var) show early use of trepanation to treat trauma or other pathologies. Four cases of this surgical procedure found in archaeological contexts in Alsace have been published.One of the oldest identified cases comes from a recent Rubane cemetery at Hoenheim-Souffelweyersheim (Bas-Rhin). One of the graves housed an old man with a large right frontal depression with a perforation in the centre. Bone splinters seem to have been extracted after the trauma occurred.The operative choice was that of an abrasion of the external table and the diploe. However, it is difficult to comment on the origin of the perforation, choice or consequence of the bone thinning. Another skull from the same site bears the marks of an impact framed by two incisions.For these two cases, an observation phase preceded the choice of the medical protocol.Other cranial lesions observed on Early and Middle Neolithic subjects from Alsace show the difficulty of the diagnosis with the pathological aspects having to be disentangled from the surgical aspects.In the Danubian cemetery of Ensisheim \"Les Octrois\" in the Haut-Rhin, tomb 44 yielded the remains of a subject whose cranial vault shows two large depressions TR-1 (6.5 mm x 63 m) and TR-2 (95 mm x 91 mm), located on the central axis and interpreted upon discovery as scarred craniectomies. The diagnosis for TR-1 was mainly based on the newly formed bony laminae that would have covered the entire bony surface of the opening. Observation of this arch defect identifies a raised centre around which radiate five depressions. The diagnosis proposed by K. W. Alt and collaborators (1997) involved the perforation being made by successive circular scrapings and the said perforation would have been filled with scarred bone. Similar frontal alterations, published in the anthropological literature, have been the subject of different diagnoses. Significant healed frontal trepanations are known for the periods ranging from the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (at the Trou de Goujout in Teyjat, in the Dordogne, for example). Healed, they show no filling ofthe gap. The differential diagnosis for  this TR-1 defect could point to osteolytic erosion of the cranial vault followedby scarring. The TR-2 alteration was interpreted by the authors as a partially healed trepanation with a procedure consisting of an act of scraping after the development of four linear incisions defining a surface of the external table.Other pathologies, initiating osteolysis of the cranial vault, cannot be excluded, including that of a traumatic episode leading to hematoma and that of osteitis, which subsequently healed, due or not to human intervention. Whatever the possible diagnosis, that of the bone growth was effective enough to fill such a large area has, to our knowledge, never been mentioned in neurosurgery or paleoanthropology papers (Nerlich et al., 2003 ; Partiot et al., 2020). It is therefore necessary, in the future, to look at the healing and regrowth processes of cranial bone in the light of a well-supported differential diagnosis.The necropolis of Lingolsheim (Bas-Rhin) dating to the Middle Neolithic Grossgartach yielded the burial of a young adult with rich grace goods. The individual had a cranial lacuna described as a double trepanation (Forrer, 1938). The loss of bone affects the bregma, the left parietal and slightly the right parietal. The phases of alteration and healing of the edges of the orifice make it possible to identify a series of events that led to the perforation of the cranial bone andits pathological, taphonomic or anthropogenic origin provides subject for discussion. Chronologically, three episodes probably shaped this cranial opening. Firstly, a localized osteolytic lesion of exocranial development, well circumscribed, led to a bregmatic perforation of the two tables and of the diploe. The only observation of the edge, abrupt, withoutbevel, with a slightly sinuous, jagged outline and an apparent diploe and a blunt ridge, could suggest the pathological and osteolytic origin of this perforation. The use of an interactive tool has made it possible to support this differential diagnosis (Partiot et al., 2017). Menigocele, gliocele cyst and isolated eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhansian histiocytosis) are pathologies that may have generated this orifice; but due to the lack of a possible histological analysis, thisremains hypothetical. A surgical opening made in two phases by grooving-chiseling widened the gap, which was of pathological origin. The first opening, according to the healing of its bevel was cut on the left parietal. The only trace of this surgical act, a 12 mm length fragment of a slightly inclined external bevel, is completely healed. A second interventionenlarged the scarred opening. The hypothesis of post-mortem cutting or trepanation followed by immediate death can be rejected as the blunt edges of the two bone tables attest to an engaged healing process. We cannot exclude the possible link between these two interventions and the pathological orifice. Coalescence and the development of tumours from an eosinophilic granuloma may have warranted the second intervention, following external manifestations of soft tissue swelling. The surgical opening therefore includes two operations and not just one as was initially mentioned. The first individual survived the intervention by several years whereas the second only for a few months.The trepanned individual from Riedisheim (Haut-Rhin) is the most recent from Alsace. The archaeological context remains vague, Final Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, for this burial discovered during quarry work around 1888. A roughly triangular parietal gap occupies the centre of a large abraded cranial surface that evokes an act of the thinning of the vault followed by an action of cutting a shutter or enlarging the orifice. The cut marks that are still visible despite notable scarring of the edges indicate trepanation.With this overview, we note that these surgical acts remain rare in Alsace in relation to the total number of burials datingfrom the Early Neolithic to the Bronze Age. There is no local extension of the practice. Most of the individuals survived the interventions that would have been the treatment for trauma or pathology. The case from Ensisheim may have been a surgical act, but in this specific case, the marks do not seem to be due to healed trepanations and an additional study is needed.","title":"La chirurgie crânienne du Néolithique alsacien : état de la question","shortTitle":"La chirurgie crânienne du Néolithique alsacien","creators":[{"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Escolà","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Linienbandkeramik"},{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Trepanation"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Bandkeramik"},{"tag":"Elsass"},{"tag":"Großgartacher Kultur"},{"tag":"Pathologie"},{"tag":"Rubané"}],"dateAdded":"2022-10-20T08:03:18Z","dateModified":"2022-10-20T08:06:40Z","itemID":16915,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Escola2022ChirurgieCranienne"},{"key":"C9JV4I9P","version":11275,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"RessourcenKulturen","place":"Tübingen","pages":"257-272","date":"2017","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6701","seriesNumber":"6","title":"Chalcolithic Enclosures in the Lower Guadalquivir Basin.

The largest area excavation ever undertaken in the British Isles, involving around 5000 participants, recorded around 44,000 archaeological features dating from the Beaker to Anglo-Saxon periods and recovered something in the region of 1.7 million finds of Mesolithic to post-medieval date. While various publications have emerged over the intervening years, the death of both directors, insufficient funding, many organisational complications and the sheer volume of material evidence have severely delayed full publication of this extraordinary palimpsest landscape.\n\nLives in Land is the first of two major volumes which bring together all the evidence from Mucking, presenting both the detail of many important structures and assemblages and a comprehensive synthesis of landscape development through the ages: settlement histories, changing land-use, death and burial, industry and craft activities. The long time-gap since completion of the excavations has allowed the authors the unprecedented opportunity to stand back from the density of site data and place the vast sum of Mucking evidence in the wider context of the archaeology of southern England throughout the major periods of occupation and activity.\n\nLives in Land begins with a thorough evaluation of the methods, philosophy and archival status of the Mucking project against the organisational and funding background of its time, and discusses its fascinating and complex history through a period of fundamental change in archaeological practice, legislation, finance, research priorities and theoretical paradigms in British Archaeology. Subsequent chapters deal with the prehistoric landscape, each focusing on the major themes that emerge by major period from analysis and synthesis of the data. The authors draw on archival material including site notebooks and personal accounts from key participants to provide a detailed but lively account of this iconic landscape investigation.","title":"Lives in Land – Mucking excavations","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Evans","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Grahame","lastName":"Appleby","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Lucy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Rondell"},{"tag":"Befestigte Siedlung"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Kreisgraben"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:55:35Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:55:35Z","itemID":9019,"notes":[{"key":"H56NZRY4","version":2688,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"XRW782HB","note":"<p>Table of Contents</p><p>Project Context – Acknowledgements ix<br/>Summary xi<br/>Résumé xii<br/>Zusammenfassung xiii<br/> <br/>Chapter One: Introduction – Landscape and Archival Palimpsests 1<br/>Total Archaeology 2<br/>Framing Context 10<br/>Notebook Archaeology 14<br/>Project Framing (I) -

We formalise three alternative hypotheses as point process models characterised by different combinations of covariates. In addition to using traditional topographic variables, we use a form of affordance viewsheds, which we refer to as visibility fields, to investigate the visual properties of different parts of the landscape, both cultural and natural. We compare these three models by means of information criteria, and generate a fourth hybrid model by recombining variables drawn from each. The results reveal that a mixture of covariates drawn from the three hypotheses combined with a spatial interaction model provides the best overall model for the settlement pattern. We show that the settlement on Leskernick Hill was most likely the result of two separate decision-making processes, one to optimise the visibility of ritual monuments and important natural landmarks, and the other to optimise the visibility of nearby tin-extraction areas. We conclude that by using an information criterion approach it is possible to easily compare the models and identify which among these is the most satisfying in the present state of our knowledge.","title":"A House with a View?

Despite a limited repertoire of motifs such as cupmarks, boats, anthropomorphs, zoomorphs, podomorphs and circles, it shows great variability in design, elaboration and articulation. This book is a study of the Mälaren region in southern-central Sweden that includes one of the most prominent rock art clusters of southwest Uppland as well as the hinterland of Södermanland county. The rock art in this region is studied on three scales: regional, local and particular. This allows for comparisons between dense and small sites, an exploration of how the Bronze Age rock art tradition developed over time in the area, and equally how the design and articulation of certain motifs relate to contemporary settlements, waterways and varying environmental settings.\n\nPatterns and structures in the distribution and articulation of the petroglyphs show that the different motifs are not only visual expressions but very much material enactments. The motifs often physically relate to each other, the flows of water, and the microtopography and mineral contents of the rocks. The study is therefore not as much about rock art as images and symbols as it is about the ecology of rock art – the web of social and physical relations in which it was enacted and employed. From this perspective, the petroglyphs are seen as petrofacts, that is something akin to tools or devices articulated in various ways to affect humans, other-than-humans and the animacies of the coastal milieus where they were made.","title":"Ecologies of Bronze Age Rock Art.

Furthermore, Celtic art is one of Europes great artistic traditions, with the skills of Celtic craftspeople standing alongside the best of the ancient and medieval worlds. But who were the Celts? Recent research and new archaeological discoveries are continuing to transform our understanding of the idea of the Celts a subject involving much controversy and academic debate since the late 1990s. Drawing on the latest scholarship, the authors explore how the Celts have been defined differently from ancient times to the modern day, by people with different perspectives and agendas. They look, too, at what is meant by Celtic art, from its origins c.500 BC in western Europe, through its transformations and revivals in the Roman, Anglo-Saxon and medieval periods, to its rediscovery in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Over 250 remarkable objects have been selected from the collections of the British Museum, the National Museums of Scotland and other key European museums to richly illustrate the narrative and highlight the artistic accomplishments of craftspeople through the centuries. Here are iconic, intricately decorated masterpieces as well as less well-known fixtures and fittings; items of warfare and adornment; the ceremonial and the utilitarian.","title":"Celts: Art and Identity","creators":[{"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Farley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fraser","lastName":"Hunter","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Späteisenzeit"},{"tag":"Kelten"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:54:56Z","itemID":8869,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FarleyHunter2015CeltsArt"},{"key":"7HPWD25J","version":5700,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Arch.

We explore the utility of using palynological and archaeological data derived from monumental burial complexes in order to better understand the relationship between ritual activity and subsistence activities. Our case study focuses on the late Funnel Beaker (3500–2900 cal BC) and Single Grave periods (2900–2200 cal BC) in northern Germany. Here, high values for ritual activities correlated significantly with high values for economically induced landscape opening for the megalithic period (3500–3100 cal BC). In the Single Grave Period, an overall agreement of general trends between the two proxies can be observed, i.e. a declining trend in economic activity is generally associated with decreasing evidence for ritual activities and vice versa. Furthermore, our results suggest regional variation in the intensities of ritual and economic activity during both the Funnel Beaker and the Single Grave periods. We postulate a Funnel Beaker core area in the eastern part of the study area, where interdependent economic and ritual structures formed a basis for a stable socio-economic system which inherited the resilience to the adoption of innovations and new ideologies. In the western part, Funnel Beaker groups with a less intensive economic impact and a weaker interlinkage of ritual and economic activities were more open to ritual innovations emerging after 2900 cal BC, as expressed by the construction of Single Grave burials.","title":"Ritual and economic activity during the Neolithic in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany: an approach to combine archaeological and palynological evidence","creators":[{"firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Feeser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Furholt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Norddeutschland"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Einzelgrabkultur"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Pollenanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:41Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:52:41Z","itemID":8117,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FeeserFurholt2014RitualEconomic"},{"key":"T4GBM8PD","version":10494,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"New York - London","pages":"255-279","date":"1995","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6494","title":"The Emergence of Inequality: A Focus on Strategies and Processes","creators":[{"firstName":"Gary M.","lastName":"Feinman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.

The understanding of the societal structure in the Bronze Age is based on a binary gender system and the variation within these gender categories is emphasised as highly significant for our understanding of gendered social roles in the Early Nordic Bronze Age (NBA). This paper demonstrates that elite women in Early NBA (c.1600–1100 BCE) held high social standing as well as holding multi-facetted social roles, reflecting both status and identity but with a change in status observed from NBA period II to III (c. 1300 BCE onwards). Network investigations of the female graves revealed that one armring in particular was dominant in the material and is seen a key identity marker for Early Nordic Bronze Age women. Further, it is concluded that analyses of object-type combinations can point towards potential dual identities of some of these women.","title":"One Ring to Rule Them All?

As a male-oriented study, the intent is to develop current perspectives on gender roles in the Early NBA in relation to mobility. In order to achieve our aim, we conducted strontium isotope analyses and radiocarbon dating combined with an in-depth archaeological investigation of grave goods obtained from two male burials from the Vejle region, SE Jutland.&nbsp; To contextualise the case study results, we also conducted network analyses of male gear from burials and ritual deposits on a regional scale, which reveal differentiated roles among men in the upper social echelon. The warrior emerged as an overall identity for high-ranking males whilst differences in male weaponry interestingly suggest that a minimum of three kinds of warriors were distinguished, reflecting social roles in war and society. The results suggest that one of the individuals was local while the other might have moved. The overall aim is to demonstrate that robust results regarding gendered mobilities will depend on the combination of several methods, datasets and scales of inquiry. &nbsp;","title":"Male Social Roles and Mobility in the Early Nordic Bronze Age.

The methodological and empirical problems associated with grinding stones as archaeological source material have led me through interdisciplinary studies to search for alternative interpretations and new angles of approach to understand what constitutes grinding contexts. & a part of my thesis work I have studied three metaphorical grinding aspects that are important for the elucidation ofthe grinding action: cyclicity oftime, sexual reproduction, and transformation or change. Each theme includes various concrete expressions such as fragmentation, rhythm, body and stone/tool. In this article I discuss some of them.","title":"Fertility and the Repetitive Partition Grinding a Social Construction","creators":[{"firstName":"Titti","lastName":"Fendin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Mahlsteine"},{"tag":"Agency"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:56:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:56:55Z","itemID":9267,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fendin2000FertilityRepetitive"},{"key":"FVSVIBLB","version":4044,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Vägar Till Midgård","place":"Lund","pages":"85-97","date":"2006","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6308","seriesNumber":"8","title":"Grinding processes and reproductive metaphors","creators":[{"firstName":"Titti","lastName":"Fendin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Andrén","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Kristina","lastName":"Jennbert","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Catharina","lastName":"Raudvere","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Mahlsteine"},{"tag":"Agency"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:56:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:56:56Z","itemID":9269,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fendin2006GrindingProcesses","publicationTitle":"Old Norse religion in long-term perspectives.

However, the spread of these ancestries into the western Mediterranean, where they have contributed to many populations that live today, remains poorly understood. Here, we generated genome-wide ancient-DNA data from the Balearic Islands, Sicily and Sardinia, increasing the number of individuals with reported data from 5 to 66. The oldest individual from the Balearic Islands (~2400 bc) carried ancestry from steppe pastoralists that probably derived from west-to-east migration from Iberia, although two later Balearic individuals had less ancestry from steppe pastoralists. In Sicily, steppe pastoralist ancestry arrived by ~2200 bc, in part from Iberia; Iranian-related ancestry arrived by the mid-second millennium bc, contemporary to its previously documented spread to the Aegean; and there was large-scale population replacement after the Bronze Age. In Sardinia, nearly all ancestry derived from the island’s early farmers until the first millennium bc, with the exception of an outlier from the third millennium bc, who had primarily North African ancestry and who—along with an approximately contemporary Iberian—documents widespread Africa-to-Europe gene flow in the Chalcolithic. Major immigration into Sardinia began in the first millennium bc and, at present, no more than 56–62% of Sardinian ancestry is from its first farmers. This value is lower than previous estimates, highlighting that Sardinia, similar to every other region in Europe, has been a stage for major movement and mixtures of people.","title":"The spread of steppe and Iranian-related ancestry in the islands of the western Mediterranean","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel M.","lastName":"Fernandes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alissa","lastName":"Mittnik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iñigo","lastName":"Olalde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iosif","lastName":"Lazaridis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Cheronet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadin","lastName":"Rohland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Swapan","lastName":"Mallick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Bernardos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nasreen","lastName":"Broomandkhoshbacht","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Carlsson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brendan J.","lastName":"Culleton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Ferry","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beatriz","lastName":"Gamarra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martina","lastName":"Lari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Mah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Michel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Modi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Novak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Oppenheimer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kendra A.","lastName":"Sirak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristin","lastName":"Stewardson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kirsten","lastName":"Mandl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Constanze","lastName":"Schattke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kadir T.","lastName":"Özdoğan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Lucci","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Gasperetti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Candilio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gianfranca","lastName":"Salis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Vai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edgard","lastName":"Camarós","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carla","lastName":"Calò","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Catalano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marián","lastName":"Cueto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vincenza","lastName":"Forgia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Lozano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elisabetta","lastName":"Marini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Margherita","lastName":"Micheletti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roberto M.","lastName":"Miccichè","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria R.","lastName":"Palombo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Damià","lastName":"Ramis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vittoria","lastName":"Schimmenti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pau","lastName":"Sureda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luís","lastName":"Teira","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Teschler-Nicola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Douglas J.","lastName":"Kennett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carles","lastName":"Lalueza-Fox","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Patterson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sineo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Coppa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Caramelli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Pinhasi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"},{"tag":"Mittelmeerraum"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:26Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:26Z","itemID":10742,"notes":[],"citationKey":"FernandesEtAl2020SpreadSteppe"},{"key":"AR8SX396","version":21525,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43026-9","volume":"13","issue":"1","pages":"17103","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","ISSN":"2045-2322","date":"2023-11-02","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-43026-9","accessDate":"2023-11-03T06:35:50Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","abstractNote":"This paper explores the nature and extent of conflict in Late Neolithic Europe based on expanded skeletal evidence for violence from the San Juan ante Portam Latinam rockshelter in present-day Spain (ca. 3380–3000 cal. BC). The systematic osteological re-examination has identified 65 unhealed and 89 healed traumas—of which 77 were previously undocumented—consistent with aggression. They affect 23.1% of the 338 individuals represented. Adolescent and adult males are particularly affected (44.9% of the 107 identified), comprising 97.6% of unhealed trauma and 81.7% of healed trauma recorded in individuals whose sex could be estimated and showing higher frequencies of injuries per individual than other demographic subgroups. Results suggest that many individuals, essentially men, were exposed to violence and eventually killed in battle and raids, since warriorship is mainly restricted to this demographic in many societies. The proportion of casualties is likely to have been far greater than indicated by the 10.1% individuals exhibiting unhealed trauma, given the presence of isolated cases of unhealed postcranial trauma and of arrowheads potentially having impacted into soft tissues. This, together with skeletal indicators of poor health and the possible socioeconomic outcomes evidenced in the region, suggest wider social impacts, which may relate to a more sophisticated and formalized way of warfare than previously appreciated in the European Neolithic record.","title":"Large-scale violence in Late Neolithic Western Europe based on expanded skeletal evidence from San Juan ante Portam Latinam | Scientific Reports","creators":[{"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Fernández-Crespo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Ordoño","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Etxeberria","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lourdes","lastName":"Herrasti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ángel","lastName":"Armendariz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José I.","lastName":"Vegas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rick J.","lastName":"Schulting","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Spätneolithikum"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Trauma"},{"tag":"Gewalt"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Sonderbestattung"},{"tag":"Massengrab"}],"dateAdded":"2023-11-03T06:35:50Z","dateModified":"2023-11-03T06:35:50Z","itemID":31502,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fernandez-CrespoEtAl2023LargescaleViolence"},{"key":"PWTR9GE4","version":2345,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"33","issue":"4","pages":"379-394","publicationTitle":"Oxford Journal of Archaeology","ISSN":"0262-5253","date":"2014/11/01","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7381","DOI":"10.1111/ojoa.12043","abstractNote":"Summary For a long time, the origins and development of Late Iron Age oppida were viewed from predominantly economic perspectives and as dependent on contacts with the Mediterranean world.

This article emphasizes the political and religious role of continental European oppida, understanding them as a new ?technology of power?, which enabled a more hierarchical and centralizing ideology to be articulated.

This paper focuses on the political and religious role of the continental oppida, showing that the existence of places for cultic purposes and holding assemblies very often pre‐dated the development of major settlements on the sites, a phenomenon which has profound implications for our understanding of Iron Age urbanisation. Religion appears to be an essential element in centralisation processes, being at the root of the fusion of previously scattered communities. Moreover, ancestor worship seems to have been at the centre of numerous public cults, and barrows very often acted as foci for political and religious meetings.","title":"Sanctuaries and ancestor worship at the origin of the oppida","creators":[{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Fernández-Götz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Matei","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"V.","lastName":"Sirbu","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Religion"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Mitteleuropa"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Späteisenzeit"},{"tag":"Kelten"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"},{"tag":"Oppida"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:48Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:48Z","itemID":8512,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fernandez-Gotz2014SanctuariesAncestor","publicationTitle":"Residential Centres (dava, emporium, oppidum, hilfort, polis) and Cult Places in the Second Iron Age of Europe"},{"key":"RJ73C75C","version":8142,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","publisher":"Oxbow Books","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5693","abstractNote":"Exploring the origins of urbanism – the emergence and development of the first cities, has long constituted one of the main challenges of archaeological and ancient historical research. Studying cities in a long-term and cross-cultural perspective links the past with the present, allowing a better understanding of one of the most important developments in human history. Moreover, archaeological research on ancient cities can contribute to a better understanding of contemporary processes of urbanisation.\nThe 21 papers in this volume aim bring together the latest continental and English-speaking research with contributions by well-established researchers and younger colleagues providing innovative perspectives. The whole Iron Age – ca. 800 BC to the beginning of the Common Era – is considered on an international basis to consider such topics as the similarities and differences observed between centralisation and urbanisation processes of the Early and Late Iron Age; new approaches to the internal organisation of settlements and their formation processes; the supply management of central places and economic support from their environment; and the crucial role of sanctuaries in the formation of urban settlements. Contributions cover an area stretching from central Spain to Moravia and from southern France to Britain. The aim has been to produce a work of reference for readers interested in Iron Age archaeology in particular, and in urbanisation processes in general.","title":"Paths to Complexity: Centralisation and Urbanisation in Iron Age Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Fernández-Götz","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Wendling","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Katja","lastName":"Winger","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Früheisenzeit"},{"tag":"Urbanisierung"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"},{"tag":"Späteisenzeit"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:32Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:27:32Z","itemID":8060,"notes":[{"key":"S9F23D5T","version":2638,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"RJ73C75C","note":"<p>Preface Prof. Michael E.

It considers the role of mass fatality sites in discussions on Neolithic violence and presents a case study to try to get closer to the question of the human experience of violent interaction in this transformative period of human history. Mass graves, or more generally mass fatality sites, present a particular challenge in discussions of Neolithic violence and conflict. The noticeable increase in research and publication on anthropological and archaeological aspects of violence and warfare within the last few decades has added a number of literature surveys to the available data. Violent interaction in the Central-Northern European Neolithic has become a well-researched topic over the last decade. Of all the archaeological lines of evidence available to us, skeletal remains bearing signs of trauma are the only direct evidence of physical violent interaction and its scale.","title":"Conflict and violence in the Neolithic of Central-Northern Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Fibiger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Fernandez-Götz","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Roymans","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Mitteleuropa"},{"tag":"Trauma"},{"tag":"Gewalt"},{"tag":"Bandkeramik"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Sonderbestattung"}],"dateAdded":"2023-01-20T09:59:13Z","dateModified":"2023-01-20T10:03:13Z","itemID":27507,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Fibiger2017ConflictViolence","publicationTitle":"Materialities of Collective Violence from Prehistory to Late Antiquity"},{"key":"HWFCCWCK","version":7733,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.22192","volume":"150","issue":"2","pages":"190-202","publicationTitle":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","ISSN":"1096-8644","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5232","journalAbbreviation":"Am J Phys Anthropol","DOI":"10.1002/ajpa.22192","abstractNote":"This article examines evidence for violence as reflected in skull injuries in 378 individuals from Neolithic Denmark and Sweden (3,900–1,700 BC). It is the first large-scale crossregional study of skull trauma in southern Scandinavia, documenting skeletal evidence of violence at a population level. We also investigate the widely assumed hypothesis that Neolithic violence is male-dominated and results in primarily male injuries and fatalities. Considering crude prevalence and prevalence for individual bones of the skull allows for a more comprehensive understanding of interpersonal violence in the region, which is characterized by endemic levels of mostly nonlethal violence that affected both men and women. Crude prevalence for skull trauma reaches 9.4% in the Swedish and 16.9% in the Danish sample, whereas element-based prevalence varies between 6.2% for the right frontal and 0.6% for the left maxilla, with higher figures in the Danish sample. Significantly more males are affected by healed injuries but perimortem injuries affect males and females equally. These results suggest habitual male involvement in nonfatal violence but similar risks for both sexes for sustaining fatal injuries. In the Danish sample, a bias toward front and left-side injuries and right-side injuries in females support this scenario of differential involvement in habitual interpersonal violence, suggesting gendered differences in active engagement in conflict. It highlights the importance of large-scale studies for investigating the scale and context of violence in early agricultural societies, and the existence of varied regional patterns for overall injury prevalence as well as gendered differences in violence-related injuries.
