What role and meaning did Hopewell earthworks play within these ancient societies? Ultimately, can they teach us anything or help us see things anew? This collection of essays addresses important questions, like these and others, by examining the cultural and social nature of the well-known Ohio Hopewell monumental earthworks. Scholars discuss the purpose, meaning, and role of earthworks and other artifacts, theorizing on how they may have reflected political, social, and practical ecological organization. Presented in a unique \"dialogical\" structure, this series of open conversations and debates about divergent archaeological practices provides a unique opportunity for the contributors to directly assess their colleagues' various approaches to studying these ancient communities. © 2010 by A.

In Near Eastern archaeology, site boundaries are usually defined by the presence of architectural and other macroscopic archaeological remains. Here we use the phytolith concentrations and morphotype assemblages as well as changes in the mineralogical composition of the sediments in and around the small Iron Age site of Izbet Sartah in central Israel to determine the site boundaries. The site has a shallow stratigraphy and highly bioturbated sediments. Coincidental changes in the clay/quartz ratio and phytolith concentrations define the boundary between high and low impact anthropogenic activities. This boundary is generally some 20 meters away from the architectural remains. In addition, we note that the phytoliths in the site’s core show clear evidence of having been affected by chemical dissolution (i.e., diagenesis), while those in the vicinity of the site’s boundary have undergone severe diagenesis. These observations indicate that phytolith diagenesis will affect site boundaries determination, as well as phytolith-based reconstructions of activity areas. We propose that phytolith preservation depends on the initial amount of available silica, the depth of burial with respect to the active root area of modern vegetation, and the presence of fresh phytoliths in the soil.","title":"Human impact around settlement sites: A phytolith and mineralogical study for assessing site boundaries, phytolith preservation, and implications for spatial reconstructions using plant remains","creators":[{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Cabanes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuval","lastName":"Gadot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maite","lastName":"Cabanes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Finkelstein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Weiner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ruth","lastName":"Shahack-Gross","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Phytolithenanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:49:05Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:49:05Z","itemID":6838,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CabanesEtAlHumanImpact"},{"key":"WX7TWXNE","version":18363,"itemType":"presentation","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tIeoPcw4D8","place":"Dublin","date":"2022-10-10","accessDate":"2023-01-27T19:46:54Z","meetingName":"NMS Archaeology Conference 2022","title":"LOOKING AT LUNULAE LINES.

Moreover, elements of the construction that are potentially unique to this type of monument are repeated, suggesting a knowledge of the properties of materials and their inter-relationships within the mounds. Here, referencing between and within the mounds is considered alongside the connections these soils, sediments, and other earth-sourced materials contained in relation to the cultural landscape. The selection of such materials and the location of the burials in the landscape were fundamental to the creation of a performative scene for the burial rites, and for establishing a desired, interlinked, social memory.\n, \nL'auteur de cet article examine les détails relatifs à la construction de tertres érigés au-dessus de grands navires vikings en Norvège et démontre qu'ils faisaient partie intégrale des rites funéraires. Certains éléments répétés dans leur construction les distinguent, les démarquant comme des monuments potentiellement uniques; ces caractéristiques suggèrent que leurs créateurs connaissaient les qualités des matériaux qu'ils utilisaient et révèlent leurs rapports au sein des tertres. L'examen des qualités référentielles des sols utilisés dans la construction de divers tumuli, ainsi que les connections entre sols, sédiments et autres matières minérales et végétales employés dans ces tertres, est mis en rapport avec le paysage culturel. Le choix de matériau et la situation des monuments dans le paysage étaient des éléments essentiels des cérémonies funéraires, créant une scène pour leur représentation et pour la création d'une mémoire sociale commune.

Darüber hinaus deuten wiederholt verwendete Bauelemente, die potenziell eigenartig für diese Art von Denkmälern sind, auf eine Kenntnis der spezifischen Eigenschaften der Materialien und deren Zusammenhänge innerhalb der Grabhügel. Die Beziehungen innerhalb und zwischen den Grabhügeln, sowie die Verknüpfungen mit Erde, Sedimenten und anderen Erdstoffen, werden im Verhältnis zur Kulturlandschaft betrachtet. Die Wahl von Materialien und die Lage der Grabhügel in der Landschaft waren für die Durchführung von Bestattungszeremonien und für die Schaffung eines einheitlichen sozialen Gedächtnisses grundsätzlich.

Within these burial mounds internal references to time, place and the transformations and imbued associations within the earth-sourced materials are purposeful and significant. This is illustrated via comparable examples from southern Norway, and to add contrast, cases from the Viking Age Isle of Man will be explored.

To the best of our knowledge, we have collected all the published 14C dates for the archaeological sites in the region from the Ebro River (Spain) to the Middle Danube Valley (Austria) for the period 1800–750 BC. The available archaeological information associated with the 14C dates was organized in a database that totaled more than 1600 14C dates. In order to build an accurate and precise chronology, quality selection rules have been applied to the 14C dates based on both archaeological context and analytical quality. Using the OxCal software and Bayesian analysis, several 14C time sequences were created following the archaeological data and different possible scenarios were tested in northern Italy and southern France.","title":"EUBAR: A Database of 14C Measurements for the European Bronze Age.

However, it does not reflect a monolithic cultural identity during the second half of the third millennium BCE, but rather real blended cultural practices reconciled at regional levels through ongoing interactions between collective and individual symbolic concepts. In Central Iberia, recent studies of the Bell Beaker funerary contexts have revealed recurrent practices, such the excavations of artificial caves and hypogea and the post-depositional extraction and movement of some human bones, as in the well-known Camino de las Yeseras site (San Fernando de Henares, Madrid). Our aim in this contribution is to investigate the correlations between the distribution of Bell Beaker patterns and ceramics in the graves, and their potential significance for the community. In this way, are we able to establish relationships between the decoration of Bell Beaker vases and the individuals buried in single or collective graves, using similarity indexes between ceramics and network representations? Some decorative patterns are age- or gender-specific? Do stylistic identities have any relation to DNA heritage? To address these questions, we have performed a “Similarity Network Analysis”. The degree of similarity between the decorations executed on the vases from single graves and those deposited in collective graves could help to highlight specific burial categories or individuals involved in the spread of particular decorative patterns. Network analysis tools can lead us to visualise these intra-site interactions, and gain greater understanding of the social context and the diversity of burial dynamics. The vessels analysed belong to eight Bell Beaker tombs documented in Camino de las Yeseras. With this approach, we want to highlight the presumed impact of intra-site relations on the Bell Beaker practices and funerary rituals within the first metallurgical societies of Central Iberia.","title":"Beyond the Burial Vase, the Community?

Although most approaches can be referred to classification tasks, in this contribution a particular type of Neural Network is proposed for feature extraction from archaeological ceramics. Through this proposed method it is possible to gain a numerical weighted representation of the pottery profile that can be used for multivariate analyses. The case study will focus on regionalisation processes in pottery production between the end of the 2nd millennium BC and the first half of the 1st millennium BC in central Tyrrhenian Italy, a period that saw major transformations in the cultural and socio-political structure of Ancient Italy. The results seem to confirm the regionalisation hypothesis and offer interesting insights into the quantitative study of archaeological ceramics.","title":"A deep variational convolutional Autoencoder for unsupervised features extraction of ceramic profiles.

This Beaker material culture has a long history of archaeological research and has resulted in this period being named after a style of pottery, the Beaker. However, the funerary record for this period is one that exhibits substantial variability. This paper considers how the archaeological narrative of the Beaker period has been constructed and presents a set of examples that exclude Beaker pottery and Beaker artefacts from the grave assemblage, located in southern England. Herein, it is questioned what these burials represent and whether they can be considered Beaker burials or represent other identities co-existing with Beaker using societies. Whilst the Beaker period does not represent an unchanging, fixed set of traditions over time or space, the examples employed demonstrate non-Beaker related burials to have been present from early in the Beaker period. We aim to highlight this important aspect of the archaeological record as requiring more research and synthesis, and promote discussion of non- Beaker identities during this dynamic period of prehistory.","title":"Multiple identities in the Beaker period: interpreting inhumations out of the Beaker spotlight in southern England","shortTitle":"Multiple identities in the Beaker period","creators":[{"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Carey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Higham","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Sozialarchäologie"},{"tag":"henge monuments"},{"tag":"Soziale Identität"}],"dateAdded":"2021-11-15T14:48:42Z","dateModified":"2021-11-15T14:51:00Z","itemID":12158,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CareyHigham2020MultipleIdentities"},{"key":"7PZ6JSIE","version":13967,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09983-3","rights":"2022 The Author(s)","volume":"12","issue":"1","pages":"6101","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","ISSN":"2045-2322","date":"2022-04-12","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-09983-3","accessDate":"2022-05-04T11:58:27Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"The article discusses results of organic residue analysis performed on ten copper-alloy daggers from Bronze Age Pragatto, Italy, c.1550–1250 BCE. Metal daggers are widespread in Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Europe, yet their social and practical roles are still hotly debated. Are they symbolic or functional? Are they tools or weapons? How were they used? For what tasks and on what materials? The research addresses these questions through a novel application of biochemical staining and SEM–EDX analysis. The method has proved successful in extracting and identifying animal residues located on cutting edges including bone, muscle, and tendons. These are interpreted as evidence of prehistoric carcass butchering and carving. Further residues were observed on blade faces and hafting plates or tangs; these are interpreted as remnants of bone handles and sheaths, the latter made of either wood fibers or processed hide and fur. The readings proposed in the article are validated by original experiments with replica daggers, as detailed in the Supplementary Materials. The analysis and experiments shed new light on Bronze Age metal daggers, showing that they were fully functional tools (and perhaps tool-weapons) primarily utilized for the processing of animal carcasses.

The nature and social significance of this phenomenon, as well as the reasons for its rapid and widespread transmission have been much debated. The adoption of these new ideas and objects in Ireland, Europe's westernmost island, provdes a highly suitable case study in which to investigate these issues. While many Beaker-related stone and metal artefacts were previously known from Ireland, a decade of intensive developer-led excavations (1997-2007) resulted in an exponential increase in discoveries of Beaker pottery within apparent settlement contexts across the island. This scenario is radically different from Europe where these objects are found with Beakers in funerary settings, stereotypically with single burials. Using an innovative approach, this book interlinks the study of the pottery and various object types (that have traditionally been studied in siolation) with their context of discovery and depositional treatment to characterise social practices within settlements, funerary monuments, ceremonial settings and natural places. These characterisations deliver rich new understandings of this period which reveal a much more nuanced narrative for this international phenomenon. Significantly, this integrated regional study reveals that the various Beaker-related objects found in Ireland were all deposited during a series of highly structured and rule-bound activities which were strongly influenced by pre-existing Irish traditions. This is a departure from previous interpretations which incorrectly attributed the adoption of Beakers to large-scale immigration or a prestige goods economy.

It is located in one of the richest archaeological landscapes of Iberia, with notable examples of Prehistoric monumental architecture such as menhirs and portal tombs (antas). A team from the University of Málaga (Spain) has been carrying out fieldwork in collaboration with the Portuguese entity ERA Arqueologia at the site since 2008. This includes geophysical (2008-2009) and micro-topographical (2011) surveys of the whole site, as well as both open-area excavations (2012-2013) and trenches (2009-2010, 2013) in the area surrounding Entrance 1.\nDigital photogrammetry is an inexpensive computerised method that enables the creation of three-dimensional models from photographs using image pattern recognition. The technique can be employed during the process of excavation to better record the archaeological evidence, to generate 3D models of the stratigraphical units and to digitalise singular findings. It is also useful for activities aiming to spread knowledge and awareness about the site. In this paper we will describe the basics of the method and its workflows, and three specific applications at Perdigões.","title":"Using digital photogrammetry to produce 3D models at prehistoric ditched enclosures: Perdigões as a case study","creators":[{"firstName":"José L.","lastName":"Caro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José Enrique","lastName":"Márquez Romero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Víctor","lastName":"Jiménez Jáimez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Kamermans","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Wieke","lastName":"de Neef","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Piccoli","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Axel G.","lastName":"Posluschny","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Scopigno","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Befestigung"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"3D-Modelle"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Rekonstruktion"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:57:16Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:57:16Z","itemID":9321,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CaroEtAl2016UsingDigital","publicationTitle":"The Three Dimensions of Archaeology.

Climate reconstructions suggest an early-middle Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) followed by gradual cooling, whereas climate models indicate continuous warming. This discrepancy either implies seasonal biases in proxy-based climate reconstructions, or that the climate model sensitivity to forcings and feedbacks needs to be reevaluated. Here, we analyze a global database of Holocene paleotemperature records to investigate the spatiotemporal structure of the HTM. Continental proxy records at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere portray a “classic” HTM (8–4 ka). In contrast, marine proxy records from the same latitudes reveal an earlier HTM (11–7ka), while a clear temperature anomaly is missing in the tropics. The results indicate a heterogeneous response to climate forcing and highlight the lack of globally synchronous HTM.","title":"Complex spatio-temporal structure of the Holocene Thermal Maximum","creators":[{"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Cartapanis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Jonkers","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paola","lastName":"Moffa-Sanchez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Samuel L.","lastName":"Jaccard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"de Vernal","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mesolithikum"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Klimarekonstruktion"}],"dateAdded":"2022-10-20T06:26:31Z","dateModified":"2022-10-20T06:27:10Z","itemID":16914,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CartapanisEtAl2022ComplexSpatiotemporal"},{"key":"AQ4AWFB5","version":13844,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-world-history-of-violence/combat-sports-in-ancient-greece-and-rome/86D35FE8C1FFD4154ADF2CF744419052","series":"The Cambridge World History of Violence","place":"Cambridge","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","pages":"493-511","ISBN":"978-1-316-34124-7","date":"2020","extra":"DOI: 10.1017/9781316341247.026","accessDate":"2022-04-11T11:46:59Z","seriesNumber":"1","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge University Press","abstractNote":"Athletic competition played an important role in ancient Greek and Roman culture. From the earliest days, competitive athletics included the combat sports of boxing, wrestling and pankration. Though athletic combat sports continued during the Roman period along with the increase in agonistic festivals and retained their popularity and importance, the spectacle of gladiatorial combat itself also spread throughout the Roman Empire, including the Greek eastern sections. Combat sports presented the spectator with extreme acts of violence which were potentially even fatal. But that violence was controlled and purposive. It took place in ceremonial contexts – funerals, or religious festivals primarily – with athletes wearing special uniforms: nudity in the case of combat athletes and identifiable armaments for gladiators. The fights were not violent chaos or murderous free-for-alls, but regulated and controlled by rules and expectations, all monitored by referees and the watching people themselves. These games were able to give visible expression to the values and ideology at the heart of Greek and Roman societies: courage, skill and discipline, perseverance to victory against all adversity and at all costs, even one’s life, and the ostentatious demonstration of personal excellence. The public nature of the performances is critical: it must be seen to be legitimised.

In the Mediterranean area, the\n4.2 ka BP event is recorded with contrasting\nexpressions between regions. In the southern Alps, the high-altitude Lake\nPetit (Mercantour Massif, France; 2200 m a.s.l.) offers pollen and\ndiatom-rich sediments covering the last 4800 years. A multi-proxy analysis\nrecently revealed a detrital pulse around 4200 cal BP due to increasing\nerosion in the lake catchment. The involvement of a rapid climate change leading\nto increasing runoff and soil erosion was proposed. Here, in order to clarify\nthis hypothesis, we measured the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica\nfrustules (δ18Odiatom) from the same sedimentary core.\nDiatoms were analysed by laser fluorination isotope ratio mass spectrometry\nafter an inert gas flow dehydration. We additionally enhanced the accuracy of\nthe age–depth model using the\nBacon R package. The\nδ18Odiatom record allows us to identify a 500-year time\nlapse, from 4400 to 3900 cal BP, where δ18Odiatom reached its\nhighest values (>31 ‰). δ18Odiatom was about\n3 ‰ higher than the modern values and the shifts at 4400 and\n3900 cal BP were of similar amplitude as the seasonal δ18Odiatom shifts occurring today. This period of high δ18Odiatom values can be explained by the intensification of\n18O-enriched Mediterranean precipitation events feeding the lake during\nthe ice-free season. This agrees with other records from the southern Alps\nsuggesting runoff intensification around 4200 cal BP. Possible changes in\nother climatic parameters may have played a concomitant role, including a decrease\nin the contribution of 18O-depleted Atlantic winter precipitation to the\nlake water due to snow deficit. Data recording the 4.2 ka BP event in the\nnorth-western Mediterranean area are still sparse. In the Lake Petit\nwatershed, the 4.2 ka BP event translated into a change in precipitation\nregime from 4400 to 3900 cal BP. This record contributes to the recent\nefforts to characterize and investigate the geographical extent of the\n4.2 ka BP event in the Mediterranean area.","title":"Diatom-oxygen isotope record from high-altitude Lake Petit (2200 m a.s.l.) in the Mediterranean Alps: shedding light on a climatic pulse at 4.2 ka","shortTitle":"Diatom-oxygen isotope record from high-altitude Lake Petit (2200 m a.s.l.) in the Mediterranean Alps","creators":[{"firstName":"Rosine","lastName":"Cartier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"Sylvestre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Paillès","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Corinne","lastName":"Sonzogni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martine","lastName":"Couapel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Alexandre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean-Charles","lastName":"Mazur","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elodie","lastName":"Brisset","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cécile","lastName":"Miramont","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frédéric","lastName":"Guiter","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Klimageschichte"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Alpenraum"},{"tag":"4.2k Event"}],"dateAdded":"2021-12-14T21:58:30Z","dateModified":"2021-12-14T21:58:30Z","itemID":12628,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CartierEtAl2019DiatomoxygenIsotope"},{"key":"H5JJTI77","version":12574,"itemType":"book","series":"Les Arènes BD","edition":"3e éd.","place":"Paris","publisher":"les Arènes","ISBN":"978-2-35204-922-7","date":"2021-05-20","callNumber":"641.220 9","libraryCatalog":"BnF ISBN","language":"fre","title":"L'incroyable histoire du vin: de la préhistoire à nos jours, 10000 ans d'aventure","shortTitle":"L'incroyable histoire du vin","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Casanave","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benoist","lastName":"Simmat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Muller","creatorType":"contributor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"#Keramikdepot_Melchingen"},{"tag":"Wein"}],"dateAdded":"2022-01-31T08:55:04Z","dateModified":"2022-01-31T08:57:13Z","itemID":12733,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CasanaveSimmat2021IncroyableHistoire"},{"key":"46GCMFM5","version":2321,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Nature","ISSN":"1476-4687","date":"2020/04/08","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7132","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2178-z","abstractNote":"Pottery is one of the most commonly recovered artefacts from archaeological sites. Despite more than a century of relative dating based on typology and seriation1, accurate dating of pottery using the radiocarbon dating method has proven extremely challenging owing to the limited survival of organic temper and unreliability of visible residues2–4. Here we report a method to directly date archaeological pottery based on accelerator mass spectrometry analysis of 14C in absorbed food residues using palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) fatty acids purified by preparative gas chromatography5–8. We present accurate compound-specific radiocarbon determinations of lipids extracted from pottery vessels, which were rigorously evaluated by comparison with dendrochronological dates9,10 and inclusion in site and regional chronologies that contained previously determined radiocarbon dates on other materials11–15. Notably, the compound-specific dates from each of the C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids in pottery vessels provide an internal quality control of the results6 and are entirely compatible with dates for other commonly dated materials. Accurate radiocarbon dating of pottery vessels can reveal: (1) the period of use of pottery; (2) the antiquity of organic residues, including when specific foodstuffs were exploited; (3) the chronology of sites in the absence of traditionally datable materials; and (4) direct verification of pottery typochronologies.

Its intriguing leaning position and its very regular morphology have aroused curiosity since medieval times. Three of its four faces—oriented towards the cardinal points—display engravings that were discovered in the 1970s. Now, a new recording protocol has combined 2D techniques for emphasizing the contrast of the engravings (oblique rotating lights) and 3D methods for restoring the volumes of the support (photogrammetry, structured-light scanner). The results obtained have made it possible to implement the first structural analysis of the stone. The north and west faces show an opposition between domestic (cattle, goats) and wild animals (suidae, cervidae, birds, cetaceans), depicted confronted and with their horns or tusks clearly visible. The south face was reserved for the human figure and for iconic artefacts (polished axe, throwing stick, ring disk, steering oar). The four faces have in common the presence of boats. The relationship linking the monument to waterways and the sea is approached by analysing both local legends and the phenomenon of the tidal wave.","title":"The ‘Historiated’ Neolithic Stele of Saint-Samson-sur-Rance (Côtes-d'Armor, France)","creators":[{"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Cassen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Grimaud","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Lescop","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hervé","lastName":"Paitier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Rodríguez-Rellán","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Armand","lastName":"Vinçotte","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Megalithik"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Bretagne"},{"tag":"Figurenstelen"}],"dateAdded":"2023-01-03T09:39:10Z","dateModified":"2023-01-03T09:39:10Z","itemID":27322,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CassenEtAl2018HistoriatedNeolithic"},{"key":"996IMYNC","version":18090,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6168","abstractNote":"Significance\nModern Europe has been shaped by two episodes in prehistory, the advent of agriculture and later metallurgy. These innovations brought not only massive cultural change but also, in certain parts of the continent, a change in genetic structure. The manner in which these transitions affected the islands of Ireland and Britain on the northwestern edge of the continent remains the subject of debate. The first ancient whole genomes from Ireland, including two at high coverage, demonstrate that large-scale genetic shifts accompanied both transitions. We also observe a strong signal of continuity between modern day Irish populations and the Bronze Age individuals, one of whom is a carrier for the C282Y hemochromatosis mutation, which has its highest frequencies in Ireland today.\nAbstract\nThe Neolithic and Bronze Age transitions were profound cultural shifts catalyzed in parts of Europe by migrations, first of early farmers from the Near East and then Bronze Age herders from the Pontic Steppe. However, a decades-long, unresolved controversy is whether population change or cultural adoption occurred at the Atlantic edge, within the British Isles. We address this issue by using the first whole genome data from prehistoric Irish individuals. A Neolithic woman (3343–3020 cal BC) from a megalithic burial (10.3× coverage) possessed a genome of predominantly Near Eastern origin. She had some hunter–gatherer ancestry but belonged to a population of large effective size, suggesting a substantial influx of early farmers to the island. Three Bronze Age individuals from Rathlin Island (2026–1534 cal BC), including one high coverage (10.5×) genome, showed substantial Steppe genetic heritage indicating that the European population upheavals of the third millennium manifested all of the way from southern Siberia to the western ocean. This turnover invites the possibility of accompanying introduction of Indo-European, perhaps early Celtic, language. Irish Bronze Age haplotypic similarity is strongest within modern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh populations, and several important genetic variants that today show maximal or very high frequencies in Ireland appear at this horizon. These include those coding for lactase persistence, blue eye color, Y chromosome R1b haplotypes, and the hemochromatosis C282Y allele; to our knowledge, the first detection of a known Mendelian disease variant in prehistory. These findings together suggest the establishment of central attributes of the Irish genome 4,000 y ago.","title":"Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome","creators":[{"firstName":"Lara M.","lastName":"Cassidy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Martiniano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eileen M.","lastName":"Murphy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew D.","lastName":"Teasdale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Mallory","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barrie","lastName":"Hartwell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel G.","lastName":"Bradley","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Irland"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:55:33Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:55:33Z","itemID":9006,"notes":[{"key":"6QPFHBX5","version":2688,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"996IMYNC","note":"<p>10.1073/pnas.1518445113</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:55:33Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:55:33Z"}],"citationKey":"CassidyEtAl2015NeolithicBronze"},{"key":"3UR9SJNR","version":18100,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2378-6","volume":"582","issue":"7812","pages":"384-388","publicationTitle":"Nature","ISSN":"1476-4687","date":"2020-06","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2378-6","accessDate":"2022-09-11T09:26:17Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","abstractNote":"The nature and distribution of political power in Europe during the Neolithic era remains poorly understood1. During this period, many societies began to invest heavily in building monuments, which suggests an increase in social organization. The scale and sophistication of megalithic architecture along the Atlantic seaboard, culminating in the great passage tomb complexes, is particularly impressive2. Although co-operative ideology has often been emphasised as a driver of megalith construction1, the human expenditure required to erect the largest monuments has led some researchers to emphasize hierarchy3—of which the most extreme case is a small elite marshalling the labour of the masses. Here we present evidence that a social stratum of this type was established during the Neolithic period in Ireland. We sampled 44 whole genomes, among which we identify the adult son of a first-degree incestuous union from remains that were discovered within the most elaborate recess of the Newgrange passage tomb. Socially sanctioned matings of this nature are very rare, and are documented almost exclusively among politico-religious elites4—specifically within polygynous and patrilineal royal families that are headed by god-kings5,6. We identify relatives of this individual within two other major complexes of passage tombs 150 km to the west of Newgrange, as well as dietary differences and fine-scale haplotypic structure (which is unprecedented in resolution for a prehistoric population) between passage tomb samples and the larger dataset, which together imply hierarchy. This elite emerged against a backdrop of rapid maritime colonization that displaced a unique Mesolithic isolate population, although we also detected rare Irish hunter-gatherer introgression within the Neolithic population.","title":"A dynastic elite in monumental Neolithic society | Nature","creators":[{"firstName":"Lara M.","lastName":"Cassidy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ros Ó","lastName":"Maoldúin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kador","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ann","lastName":"Lynch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carleton","lastName":"Jones","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter C.","lastName":"Woodman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eileen","lastName":"Murphy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Greer","lastName":"Ramsey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Dowd","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Noonan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ciarán","lastName":"Campbell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eppie R.","lastName":"Jones","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Mattiangeli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel G.","lastName":"Bradley","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Megalithik"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Kollektivgrab"},{"tag":"Kollektivbestattung"},{"tag":"Megalithgrab"},{"tag":"Megalithkultur"},{"tag":"_tag_nachtragen"},{"tag":"Patrilinealität"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2022-05-05T21:37:37Z","dateModified":"2022-12-06T15:20:30Z","itemID":16889,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CassidyEtAl2020DynasticElitea"},{"key":"PCP8PYY3","version":26359,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08409-6","rights":"2025 The Author(s)","pages":"1-7","publicationTitle":"Nature","ISSN":"1476-4687","date":"2025-01-15","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-024-08409-6","accessDate":"2025-01-20T10:36:08Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"Roman writers found the relative empowerment of Celtic women remarkable1. In southern Britain, the Late Iron Age Durotriges tribe often buried women with substantial grave goods2. Here we analyse 57 ancient genomes from Durotrigian burial sites and find an extended kin group centred around a single maternal lineage, with unrelated (presumably inward migrating) burials being predominantly male. Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines. Patterns of haplotype sharing reveal that British Iron Age populations form fine-grained geographical clusters with southern links extending across the channel to the continent. Indeed, whereas most of Britain shows majority genomic continuity from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age, this is markedly reduced in a southern coastal core region with persistent cross-channel cultural exchange3. This southern core has evidence of population influx in the Middle Bronze Age but also during the Iron Age. This is asynchronous with the rest of the island and points towards a staged, geographically granular absorption of continental influence, possibly including the acquisition of Celtic languages.","title":"Continental influx and pervasive matrilocality in Iron Age Britain","creators":[{"firstName":"Lara M.","lastName":"Cassidy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miles","lastName":"Russell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Smith","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabrielle","lastName":"Delbarre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Cheetham","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Manley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Mattiangeli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emily M.","lastName":"Breslin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iseult","lastName":"Jackson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maeve","lastName":"McCann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Little","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ciarán G.","lastName":"O’Connor","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beth","lastName":"Heaslip","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Lawson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Phillip","lastName":"Endicott","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel G.","lastName":"Bradley","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"},{"tag":"Hallstattzeit"},{"tag":"Exogamie"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"},{"tag":"Matrilinealität"},{"tag":"Matrilokalität"}],"dateAdded":"2025-01-20T10:36:08Z","dateModified":"2025-01-20T10:36:08Z","itemID":32971,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CassidyEtAl2025ContinentalInflux"},{"key":"M25B6IRJ","version":8074,"itemType":"book","place":"Lanham, Md.

Moreover, three copper lunulae were identified as possibly Tuscan, which demonstrates contacts between Italy and the Valais region. This pattern also establishes a multiplicity of provenances for the metal and cultural influences in the Alpine environment of the Rhone Valley of Switzerland at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age.","title":"Provenance of Early Bronze Age Metal Artefacts in Western Switzerland Using Elemental and Lead Isotopic Compositions and their Possible Relation with Copper Minerals of the Nearby Valais","creators":[{"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"Cattin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Guénette-Beck","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Curdy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Meisser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Ansermet","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beda","lastName":"Hofmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Kündig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vera","lastName":"Hubert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Wörle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kathrin","lastName":"Hametner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Detlef","lastName":"Günther","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Wichser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Ulrich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Igor M.","lastName":"Villa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Besse","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Mitteleuropa"},{"tag":"Kupferartefakte"},{"tag":"Rohmaterialvorkommen"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T15:40:05Z","itemID":5659,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CattinEtAlProvenanceEarly"},{"key":"PSNMADAT","version":6225,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254360","volume":"16","issue":"7","pages":"e0254360","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"Jul 28, 2021","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0254360","accessDate":"2021-08-09T06:05:11Z","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this study, we present osteological and strontium isotope data of 29 individuals (26 cremations and 3 inhumations) from Szigetszentmiklós-Ürgehegy, one of the largest Middle Bronze Age cemeteries in Hungary. The site is located in the northern part of the Csepel Island (a few kilometres south of Budapest) and was in use between c. 2150 and 1500 BC, a period that saw the rise, the apogee, and, ultimately, the collapse of the Vatya culture in the plains of Central Hungary. The main aim of our study was to identify variation in mobility patterns among individuals of different sex/age/social status and among individuals treated with different burial rites using strontium isotope analysis. Changes in funerary rituals in Hungary have traditionally been associated with the crises of the tell cultures and the introgression of newcomers from the area of the Tumulus Culture in Central Europe around 1500 BC. Our results show only slight discrepancies between inhumations and cremations, as well as differences between adult males and females. The case of the richly furnished grave n. 241 is of particular interest. The urn contains the cremated bones of an adult woman and two 7 to 8-month-old foetuses, as well as remarkably prestigious goods. Using 87Sr/86Sr analysis of different dental and skeletal remains, which form in different life stages, we were able to reconstruct the potential movements of this high-status woman over almost her entire lifetime, from birth to her final days. Our study confirms the informative potential of strontium isotopes analyses performed on different cremated tissues. From a more general, historical perspective, our results reinforce the idea that exogamic practices were common in Bronze Age Central Europe and that kinship ties among high-rank individuals were probably functional in establishing or strengthening interconnections, alliances, and economic partnerships.","title":"Human mobility in a Bronze Age Vatya ‘urnfield’ and the life history of a high-status woman","creators":[{"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cavazzuti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamás","lastName":"Hajdu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Lugli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Sperduti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Magdolna","lastName":"Vicze","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aniko","lastName":"Horváth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"István","lastName":"Major","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mihály","lastName":"Molnár","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"László","lastName":"Palcsu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viktória","lastName":"Kiss","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Nagyrév Kulturgruppe"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Vatyakultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-08-09T06:05:12Z","dateModified":"2021-08-09T06:05:12Z","itemID":11687,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CavazzutiEtAl2021HumanMobility"},{"key":"FFF85ZKV","version":13340,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10963-022-09164-0","volume":"35","issue":"1","pages":"45-86","publicationTitle":"Journal of World Prehistory","ISSN":"1573-7802","date":"2022-03-01","journalAbbreviation":"J World Prehist","DOI":"10.1007/s10963-022-09164-0","accessDate":"2022-03-24T11:15:21Z","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","language":"en","abstractNote":"Archaeological research is currently redefining how large-scale changes occurred in prehistoric times. In addition to the long-standing theoretical dichotomy between ‘cultural transmission’ and ‘demic diffusion’, many alternative models borrowed from sociology can be used to explain the spread of innovations. The emergence of urnfields in Middle and Late Bronze Age Europe is certainly one of these large-scale phenomena; its wide distribution has been traditionally emphasized by the use of the general term Urnenfelderkultur/zeit (starting around 1300 BC). Thanks to new evidence, we are now able to draw a more comprehensive picture, which shows a variety of regional responses to the introduction of the new funerary custom. The earliest ‘urnfields’ can be identified in central Hungary, among the tell communities of the late Nagyrév/Vatya Culture, around 2000 BC. From the nineteenth century BC onwards, the urnfield model is documented among communities in northeastern Serbia, south of the Iron Gates. During the subsequent collapse of the tell system, around 1500 BC, the urnfield model spread into some of the neighbouring regions. The adoption, however, appears more radical in the southern Po plain, as well as in the Sava/Drava/Lower Tisza plains, while in Lower Austria, Transdanubia and in the northern Po plain it seems more gradual and appears to have been subject to processes of syncretism/hybridization with traditional rites. Other areas seem to reject the novelty, at least until the latest phases of the Bronze Age. We argue that a possible explanation for these varied responses relates to the degree of interconnectedness and homophily among communities in the previous phases.","title":"The First ‘Urnfields’ in the Plains of the Danube and the Po","creators":[{"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cavazzuti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alberta","lastName":"Arena","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Cardarelli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Fritzl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gavranović","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamás","lastName":"Hajdu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viktória","lastName":"Kiss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kitti","lastName":"Köhler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Kulcsár","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eszter","lastName":"Melis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katharina","lastName":"Rebay-Salisbury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Géza","lastName":"Szabó","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vajk","lastName":"Szeverényi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Brandbestattung"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Italien"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Grabhügel_Wunnenstein"}],"dateAdded":"2022-03-24T11:15:22Z","dateModified":"2022-03-24T11:15:22Z","itemID":16288,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CavazzutiEtAl2022FirstUrnfields"},{"key":"3539T8AI","version":28030,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01113-z","rights":"2025 The Author(s)","volume":"15","issue":"1","pages":"17494","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","ISSN":"2045-2322","date":"2025-05-20","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-025-01113-z","accessDate":"2025-05-27T10:44:20Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"The transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age (around 1500 BCE) in the Carpathian Basin was parallel by drastic cultural changes in Central-Europe, which strongly influenced the dynamic of prehistoric Europe. The cultural fragmentation of the Middle Bronze Age (2000 − 1500 BCE) Carpathian Basin was followed by a more homogeneous development at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (1500 − 1300 BCE), with the appearance of the Tumulus culture. In the beginning of this period, the long-used tell-settlements were abandoned, furthermore new pottery styles and metal types appeared. Whether these changes were caused by immigration, or a local adaptation to external influxes, has long been a matter of debate. Our study investigates this transition from the point of view of diet and mobility from several key-sites of Hungary. Our results show (1) low migration rates and a shift of migration trajectories; that (2) the beginning of the systematic consumption of Panicum miliaceum was from 1540 − 1480 BCE; that (3) the decrease of average animal protein intake was parallel by an increase of cereal consumption and a tendency to less unequal diet. Overall, our results shed new light on the dynamics of complex change in Bronze Age Europe.","title":"Isotope and archaeobotanical analysis reveal radical changes in mobility, diet and inequalities around 1500 BCE at the core of Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cavazzuti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anikó","lastName":"Horváth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anett","lastName":"Gémes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristóf","lastName":"Fülöp","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamás","lastName":"Szeniczey","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"János Gábor","lastName":"Tarbay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ashley","lastName":"McCall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Beatriz Gamarra","lastName":"Rubio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Magdolna","lastName":"Vicze","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Annamária","lastName":"Bárány","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ákos","lastName":"Pető","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Enikő Katalin","lastName":"Magyari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Darabos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"István","lastName":"Futó","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zsuzsa","lastName":"Lisztes-Szabó","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erika","lastName":"Molnár","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Novak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erika","lastName":"Gál","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Klára P.","lastName":"Fischl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Kulcsár","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vajk","lastName":"Szeverényi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Géza","lastName":"Szabó","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edit","lastName":"Mester","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"János","lastName":"Dani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"László","lastName":"Palcsu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viktória","lastName":"Kiss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"István","lastName":"Major","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamás","lastName":"Hajdu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Mitteleuropa"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Hügelgräberkultur"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Hsdlg_FbzMbz"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"ansehen"},{"tag":"_tablet_ZotMoov"}],"dateAdded":"2025-05-27T10:44:20Z","dateModified":"2025-06-27T08:45:02Z","itemID":33284,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CavazzutiEtAl2025IsotopeArchaeobotanical"},{"key":"NDTAT37U","version":8074,"itemType":"book","series":"Monographies Instrumentum","place":"Montagnac","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5696","title":"Early Iron in Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Brigitte","lastName":"Cech","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Thilo","lastName":"Rehren","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Früheisenzeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:33Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:17:13Z","itemID":8065,"notes":[{"key":"ZSYZ9ILS","version":2638,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"NDTAT37U","note":"<p>Thilo Rehren, Brigitte Cech — Early Iron in Europe.

In this regard, the archaeological study of cremation has much to offer. Cremation is a fascinating and widespread theme and entry-point in the exploration of the variability of mortuary practices among past societies. Seeking to challenge simplistic narratives of cremation in the past and present, the studies in this volume seek to confront and explore the challenges of interpreting the variability of cremation by contending with complex networks of modern allusions and imaginings of cremations past and present and ongoing debates regarding how we identify and interpret cremation in the archaeological record. Using a series of original case studies, the book investigates the archaeological traces of cremation in a varied selection of prehistoric and historic contexts from the Mesolithic to the present in order to explore cremation from a practice-oriented and historically situated perspective.","title":"Cremation and the Archaeology of Death","creators":[{"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Cerezo-Roman","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Williams","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Wessman","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Brandbestattung"}],"dateAdded":"2017-07-17T10:02:53Z","dateModified":"2021-07-28T10:50:26Z","itemID":284,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Cerezo-RomanEtAl2017CremationArchaeology"},{"key":"VJMM8D3Y","version":3962,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"6","issue":"3","pages":"227-239","publicationTitle":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","ISSN":"1866-9557","date":"2014/09/01","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5657","DOI":"10.1007/s12520-013-0147-2","language":"English","abstractNote":"A non-invasive procedure for assessing and interpreting the pigments of rock art paintings through computer vision and photogrammetric techniques is presented.

Beyond aesthetics, it reflects technological skill, social identity, and cultural interaction. This study examines Bell Beaker pottery from north-eastern Poland, a region notable for its stylistic ties to western Bell Beaker groups and its role in early Bronze Age developments. Through detailed macro- and microscopic overview, as well as experimental research, it provides critical insights into the technical abilities of potters and the functioning of stylistic traditions, revealing both continuity and local adaptation. Decoration emerges here as a deliberate, structured practice embedded in shared cognitive frameworks: mental templates guided by a specific ‘visibility regime’. The outcomes further suggest the emergence of a local Bell Beaker community of practice, which adhered to broader stylistic conventions, while simultaneously developing its own unique approach. These findings demonstrate that pottery decoration can be a powerful tool for tracing cultural interactions, knowledge exchange, and identity formation in prehistoric Europe. By shedding light on these dynamics, this research contributes to global discussions on how material culture encodes social and technological information, making it relevant to both European prehistory specialists and anyone interested in the long-term transmission of ideas and craft traditions.","title":"Technical aspects of Bell Beaker pottery decoration in North-Eastern Poland","creators":[{"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Cetwińska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Dymańska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Manasterski","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polen"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Keramikanalyse"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"}],"dateAdded":"2025-09-05T08:22:28Z","dateModified":"2025-09-05T08:23:01Z","itemID":33393,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CetwinskaEtAl2025TechnicalAspects"},{"key":"3LXR4J35","version":2233,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Oxford","pages":"37-64","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6165","abstractNote":"This paper is based on the presentation I gave at TAG in 2012 in the session organised by Ceri Houlbrook and Natalie Armitage. It examines materialities of magic on Iron Age and Romano-British settlement sites, and using a few select case\nstudies, explores some of the interfaces between archaeological theory and practice. In particular, it examines the problems of excavating and recording the potential evidence for ritualised or magical practices on developer-funded archaeological sites in Britain, and critiques  current excavation and post-excavation methodologies. It also comments on the often negative influence of archaeological consultants on project budgets and timetables, and ultimately, on the production of archaeological knowledge itself.","title":"Doorways, ditches and dead dogs – material manifestations of practical magic in Iron Age and Roman Britain","creators":[{"firstName":"Adrian M.","lastName":"Chadwick","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ceri","lastName":"Houlbrook","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Natalie","lastName":"Armitage","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Magie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:55:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:55:29Z","itemID":9000,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Chadwick2015DoorwaysDitches","publicationTitle":"The Materiality of Magic: An artifactual investigation into ritual practices and popular beliefs"},{"key":"FLKJUK2V","version":8084,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5429","abstractNote":"Within archaeology, there has been increasing interest in the role of the past in the past. To date, however, there has been little specific discussion of how long-term persistence of place and practice was possible; and why this was the case. The sixteen papers in this volume use detailed contextual evidence to address these questions. In many instances, contributors discuss less visible examples where ‘memory work’ can be identified from non-monumental, ‘everyday’ landscapes. The case studies focus on British archaeology from the Neolithic to the early medieval period, but other contributions deal with Neolithic Central Europe, ancient Etruscan and Egyptian landscapes, and historic Native American practices. 336p, 166 b/w and col. illustrations (Oxbow Books 2013) 9781782973935 Hb £38.00","title":"Memory, Myth and Long-Term Landscape Inhabitation","creators":[{"firstName":"Adrian M.","lastName":"Chadwick","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Catriona D.","lastName":"Gibson","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:13Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:17:52Z","itemID":7583,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ChadwickGibson2013MemoryMyth"},{"key":"D4QX9F8P","version":10623,"itemType":"book","series":"Cambridge Manuals in Archaeology","place":"Cambridge","date":"2006","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3208","title":"Demography in Archaeology","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrew T.","lastName":"Chamberlain","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"Demografie"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:40:21Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:40:21Z","itemID":4534,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Chamberlain2006DemographyArchaeology"},{"key":"8VATD94V","version":5692,"itemType":"book","series":"One world archaeology","place":"London-New York","publisher":"Routledge","ISBN":"0415122538 (pbk.)","date":"1995","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3290","seriesNumber":"11","title":"Centre and periphery : comparative studies in archaeology","numPages":"xx, 240 p","creators":[{"firstName":"T.
