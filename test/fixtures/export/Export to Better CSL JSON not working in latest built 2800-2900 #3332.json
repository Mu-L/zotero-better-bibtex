Anthropologists and politicians often explain such apparently economically irrational expenditures in terms of culture values or traditions.

This socioeconomic promotion is important for attracting powerful/successful/wealthy families as affines and allies.

As stated in the<br/> book’s summary, it is the first book in decades that addresses secret <br/>societies in a comparative perspective and the first from an <br/>archaeological perspective. </p><p>The author’s goal is “to place secret societies at the forefront of <br/>archaeological consciousness and to have them occupy their rightful <br/>place in prehistorians’ accounts of how and why many important <br/>sociopolitical and religious changes took place in the past.” He argues <br/>that these societies provide the “missing link” that explains why <br/>cultures invested so much into ritual centers and how religion and <br/>ritual became associated with power and a force of cultural change. His <br/>premise is that secret societies were socially disruptive and created <br/>inequality through the control of surplus resources that enabled <br/>aggrandizers to promote their own self-interest and status. Based in <br/>political ecology, this view counters the conventional, widespread, <br/>functionalist- and Marxist-driven arguments that interpret religion and <br/>ritual as cohesive forces that reduce social tension. He argues that <br/>archaeologists speak erroneously of the power of ritual and belief and <br/>instead proposes that any power connected to ritual and religion rests <br/>in the ability of the leaders in secret societies “to exact acquiescence<br/> for the ideological and other dictates,” much of which was achieved <br/>through terror. </p><p>The book is arranged in three sections: the New World, the Old World,<br/> and implications for archaeology. Most of the content is dedicated to <br/>detailed ethnographic case studies of secret societies around the globe <br/>that the author uses to exemplify potential archaeological signatures <br/>and artifacts, which he discusses in more detail in the section on <br/>archaeology and in the conclusions. Accepting that most people will use <br/>this volume as a reference work, the author purposely structured it with<br/> the main argument laid out in the first chapter, case studies presented<br/> in chapters 2–9, and the evidence and arguments summarized in the <br/>concluding two chapters. </p><p>In the first chapter, Hayden describes secret societies, explaining <br/>why they are important and using them to support his critiques of common<br/> archeological models and interpretations. He describes them as a type <br/>of ritual sodality controlling exclusive knowledge with access to <br/>spirits and the spirit world, which is the “secret” in secret societies,<br/> and having voluntary, ranked membership, frequently with expensive <br/>fees. He argues that: they embody traditional ritual, art, food, music, <br/>dance, costume, and language; their members cut across kinship groups <br/>and communities and create a supracommunity level of control, <br/>organization, and power that is far reaching; they extract large amounts<br/> of resources from the community and direct them to a few <br/>individuals; the highest ranked individuals in a community frequently <br/>hold the highest ranks in the secret society, with access to exclusive <br/>arcane knowledge and large amounts of resources, which makes them <br/>driving forces in wide-ranging cultural change; and they lead to the <br/>development of some of the most notable ritual centers and formation of <br/>regional and state religions. Secret societies can be classified into <br/>four main types: power-oriented, militaristic, curing or fertility, and <br/>defensive. The author mainly explores the first two, since they are most<br/> commonly described in the ethnographies. The dominant activity of a <br/>secret society is often public rituals that allow members to communicate<br/> and display their arcane knowledge to the wider community. Their <br/>frequent occurrence in transegalitarian and chiefdom societies and the <br/>buildings, spaces, and paraphernalia that are visible in the <br/>archaeological record make them significant for archaeological studies <br/>of early cultures. </p><p>In chapters 2–9, which draw on detailed ethnographies collected <br/>during the 19th and early 20th centuries from a wide range of cultures, <br/>Hayden explains the various manifestations of secret societies and their<br/> characteristics, origins, and impact on people. Through these examples,<br/> he elucidates how the secret societies ensured a strong economic <br/>position for their organization by controlling surplus through <br/>membership and initiation fees, reciprocal feasts and gifts, the expense<br/> associated with rituals and paraphernalia, fines from members and <br/>nonmembers for transgressions or for doubting the ritual power, and <br/>payment from community members for transformative or protective rituals.<br/> He provides multiple examples of the high cost for higher-level <br/>initiations and how this may stretch as far as sacrifice of one’s oldest<br/> son to engender superior loyalty to the secret society that cuts across<br/> kin and community. He argues convincingly for the disruptive role of <br/>secret societies and stresses how they commonly terrorized communities, <br/>especially women and children, with extreme violence and destruction of <br/>property, and with cannibalism not uncommon. The attendant rituals must <br/>have a sufficient public presence that the effect and benefits of <br/>society membership can be fully felt. Hayden especially stresses the <br/>motivation for the societies and highlights multiple instances that show<br/> individual aggrandizers using the societies to gain social, political, <br/>and economic leverage. He also uses these examples to bolster his <br/>theoretical position in political ecology, explaining the connection <br/>between ritual and power and arguing against the more traditional views <br/>of religion as a social unifier. Throughout these case studies our <br/>attention is drawn to many examples of the secret societies’ ritual <br/>equipment that might be identifiable in the archaeological record—such <br/>as masks, specialized clothing, bodily ornaments, musical or noise <br/>instruments, figurines, and decorated implements—and their ritual <br/>structures, spaces, and burials, which are found in 25–50% of <br/>transegalitarian societies. </p><p>In chapter 10, Hayden highlights the material patterns discussed in <br/>the case studies and, using a wide range of examples, explores how they <br/>could be used to infer the presence of secret societies <br/>archaeologically. His aim is not to argue unequivocally for “the <br/>presence of secret societies but to point out examples where the <br/>application of the secret society model might prove to be insightful or <br/>productive” (285). He uses several archaeological examples to argue his <br/>case, in most of which he seems to equate small spaces and those in <br/>isolated places or outside the main residential areas with secret <br/>societies. In the example that I am most familiar with, the Minoans, he <br/>contends that the Minoan peak sanctuaries are a form of secret society <br/>that was brought into the palace. Although this is a novel <br/>interpretation—as Minoan archaeologists predominantly envision the <br/>sanctuaries as regional, communal ritual areas that were then brought <br/>under palatial control—it is an interesting model to explore. </p><p>In the final chapter, he fills the lacuna that he noted in the first <br/>chapter: the lack of explanatory power in common scholarly acceptance of<br/> the inherent power of religion. He expressly argues that secret <br/>societies are “the missing link in our understanding of why ritual, <br/>astronomy, sacrifice and religion are so important to early state <br/>societies” and became subsumed or transformed into mainstream religions.<br/> He summarizes some of the major themes discussed in the case studies <br/>and stresses the connection between the secret society and wealth <br/>acquisition, promotion of self-interests, sociopolitical control, <br/>creation of inequalities, and how secret societies were a driving force <br/>of cultural change. </p><p>This is a strong book and a fascinating account of practices not much<br/> discussed in archaeology or in cultural anthropology. It gives us clear<br/> examples of secret societies in a variety of cultures and helps us get <br/>an appreciation for how they might have functioned in the past as well <br/>as how this undermines perceived notions of the role of religion in <br/>ancient societies. A minor drawback to the work is that information is <br/>repeated within the chapter subdivisions of the area case studies, <br/>although this may be beneficial to someone who is only looking at a <br/>small subsection of the volume. </p><p>Joanne M.A. Murphy</p><p>\tUniversity of North Carolina Greensboro</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:17Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:17Z"}],"citationKey":"Hayden2018PowerRitual"},{"key":"SQ445RT2","version":4279,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"11","pages":"245-260","publicationTitle":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","date":"2017","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6910","abstractNote":"Blind tests provide an objective means to evaluate the accuracy of functional interpretations based on the presence of use-wear and residue traces on stone tools.

We present the results of a two-part blind test performed on 15 experimental grinding implements that were used in a controlled setting, designed to evaluate the relative importance of residue analysis for determining the worked material (1) when contextual information is available and (2) when contextual information is absent. We argue that use-wear and residue analyses are successful procedures to identify the use of grinding stones, and that residue analysis may be a particularly valuable means for determining the worked material on tools that have insufficient use-wear development.

The reliability of such a “dates-as-data” approach is highly dependent upon how the occurrence rates are estimated from the underlying samples, particularly when calendar age information for the samples is obtained from radiocarbon (14C). The most frequently used “14C-dates-as-data” approach of creating Summed Probability Distributions (SPDs) is not statistically valid, or coherent, and can provide highly misleading inference. Here, we provide an alternative method with a rigorous statistical underpinning that also provides valuable additional information on potential changepoints in the rate of events. Furthermore, unlike current SPD alternatives, our summarisation approach does not restrict users to pre-specified, rigid, summary formats (e.g., exponential or logistic growth) but instead flexibly adapts to the dates themselves. Our methodology ensures more reliable “14C-dates-as-data” analyses, allowing us to better assess and identify potential signals present. We model the occurrence of events, each assumed to leave a radiocarbon sample in the archaeological/environmental record, as an inhomogeneous Poisson process. The varying rate of samples over time is then estimated within a fully-Bayesian framework using reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC). Given a set of radiocarbon samples, we reconstruct how their occurrence rate varies over calendar time and identify if that rate contains statistically-significant changes, i.e., specific times at which the rate of events abruptly changes. We illustrate our method with both a simulation study and a practical example concerning late-Pleistocene megafaunal population changes in Alaska and Yukon.","title":"A new approach to radiocarbon summarisation: Rigorous identification of variations/changepoints in the occurrence rate of radiocarbon samples using a Poisson process","shortTitle":"A new approach to radiocarbon summarisation","creators":[{"firstName":"Timothy J.","lastName":"Heaton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Al-assam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edouard","lastName":"Bard","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Demografie"},{"tag":"Bayesische Statistik"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Bayesian modelling"},{"tag":"Summed probability distributions (SPDs)","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2025-09-16T06:35:16Z","dateModified":"2025-09-16T06:36:07Z","itemID":33425,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HeatonEtAl2025NewApproach"},{"key":"95LJIZRB","version":8202,"itemType":"book","place":"Quint-Fonsegrives","publisher":"EDITIONS MERGOIL","date":"2017","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6641","title":"Gaulois.

What has also been missing, is trying to use as many methods as possible to better understand their production, use and context. A database was compiled to find answers to questions regarding patterns of distribution, context, fragmentation and deformation. Aspects of production were considered through experimental archaeology, metallographic analysis and a re-discovered axe blank with missing shaft-hole. The typology was re-evaluated and modified to ensure comparability across modern national boundaries. The integration of these approaches yielded some interesting results. The great variability in shape clearly shows that a variety of production techniques were used, but it is difficult to relate these to specific geographic areas. In fact the typology as well as the practice of marking the axes indicate that traditional archaeological ‘cultures’ rarely correspond to axe types and marking practices. Instead there were different spheres of influence, some more localised and others much larger than specific ceramic traditions. These different levels of belonging show that it was a period of complex cultural patterns and interactions. The axes were part of these networks of daily life on many different levels from the utilitarian to the ritualised placement in burial contexts.","title":"Copper Shaft-Hole Axes and Early Metallurgy in South-Eastern Europe: An Integrated Approach","creators":[{"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Heeb","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:08Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:52:08Z","itemID":7929,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Heeb2014CopperShaftHole"},{"key":"BYVXCRTG","version":2305,"itemType":"book","series":"Materialh. zur Arch. in Baden-Württemberg","place":"Darmstadt","publisher":"Theiss","ISBN":"978-3-8062-2873-1","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6958","seriesNumber":"98","title":"Vorgeschichtliche Grabenanlagen bei Heilbronn-Neckargartach","creators":[{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hees","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heiligtum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Hallstattzeit"},{"tag":"Grabenanlage"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:05:34Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:05:34Z","itemID":10488,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Hees2013VorgeschichtlicheGrabenanlagen"},{"key":"XZT7EIC2","version":2252,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Stud. zur Kulturgesch. von Oberösterreich","place":"Linz","pages":"39-52","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6369","seriesNumber":"42","title":"Ein Kultplatz der jüngeren Latènezeit bei Heilbronn-Neckargartach","creators":[{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hees","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raimund","lastName":"Karl","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Jutta","lastName":"Leskovar","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Heiligtum"},{"tag":"Süddeutschland"},{"tag":"Latènezeit"},{"tag":"Grabengeviert"},{"tag":"Späteisenzeit"},{"tag":"Grabenanlage"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:57:48Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:57:48Z","itemID":9399,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Hees2015KultplatzJungeren","publicationTitle":"Interpretierte Eisenzeiten.

The focus was on analysing bulk pottery and on the possibilities of non-destructive determination of chemical composition. The number of chemical elements significant for provenance studies and determinable with sucient precision and accuracy plays a major role.

Few studies have tackled this question by linking high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological studies from near Mesolithic occupation sites. An Early Holocene sediment record from the Ammer Valley palaeo-wetland in south-west Germany was studied using pollen, micro- and macrocharcoal, and plant macroremains. Archaeological evidence from Early and Late Mesolithic sites of Rottenburg-Siebenlinden allowed us to link this palaeoecological record with Mesolithic land use in the same catchment. Between 11.6 and 10.6 cal kabp,intensive wildfires reinforced the persistence of open and pioneer vegetation. A transition from a river-dominated landscape towards a wetland with open stagnant waters at 10.6–9.5 cal ka bpmade the region attractive to hunter-gatherers, providing various plant resources (incl. hazel). From 10.1 cal ka bponwards, Mesolithic communities may have shaped their environment by using fire as a tool to expand open areas, which were important for the implementation of their subsistence strategies. After 9.5 cal ka bp, human control over fires cannot be excluded as Mesolithic occupation phases chronologically coincide with frequent low-intensity fires and vegetation disturbance.","title":"Palaeoecological signals for Mesolithic land use in a Central European landscape?","creators":[{"firstName":"Shaddai","lastName":"Heidgen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Marinova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Nelle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Ebner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Rotava","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yvonne","lastName":"Tafelmaier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raiko","lastName":"Krauß","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jörg","lastName":"Bofinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Annett","lastName":"Junginger","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mesolithikum"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Landschaftsentwicklung"}],"dateAdded":"2022-08-29T16:21:50Z","dateModified":"2025-06-12T07:48:56Z","itemID":16855,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HeidgenEtAl2022PalaeoecologicalSignals"},{"key":"4HWKATKB","version":8578,"itemType":"book","place":"Stuttgart","date":"1979","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1924","title":"Erscheinungsformen und Wesen der Religion.

This paper deals with finds that may correspond to such ritual preparations retrieved from the hillfort site of Stillfried an der March. The site, spreading across an area of ca. 23 ha, held a very important position among settlements of Late Urnfield period (particularly during the 10th– 9th c. BCE), acting as a central place where large scale storage of grain as well as textile and metal production took place under the control of local elites. Three incomplete ring-shaped charred organic objects, found together with 14 rings and ring fragments made of clay were discovered in a secondary filled silo pit, excavated among a total of about 100 pits of this kind at the site. The overall good state of preservation of the organic ring fragments suggests that they were deposited intact on the bottom of the pit and covered well so that no re-deposition or damage occurred. This could be indicate their intentional placement in this position. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the charred organic rings are cereal products containing hulled barley and a wheat species. Indications that the objects were shaped from a wet cereal mixture and had been subsequently dried without baking are discussed, as well as the possible significance of the find assemblage. The annular objects are put in context with the contemporary cereal spectrum as well as other cereal preparations from Stillfried, outlining their different chaînes opératoires for handling cereal food.","title":"The Hoard of the Rings. “Odd” annular bread-like objects as a case study for cereal-product diversity at the Late Bronze Age hillfort site of Stillfried (Lower Austria)","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas G.","lastName":"Heiss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ferran","lastName":"Antolín","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Berihuete Azorín","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Benedikt","lastName":"Biederer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Erlach","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Niki","lastName":"Gail","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Griebl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Linke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Lochner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Marinova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Oberndorfer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hans-Peter","lastName":"Stika","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Soultana Maria","lastName":"Valamoti","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Österreich"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Urnenfelderkultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:23Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:23Z","itemID":11131,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HeissEtAl2019HoardRings"},{"key":"DLM6QLF2","version":3847,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"15","issue":"5","pages":"e0231696","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","date":"2020","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7139","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0231696","abstractNote":"The detection of direct archaeological remains of alcoholic beverages and their production is still a challenge to archaeological science, as most of the markers known up to now are either not durable or diagnostic enough to be used as secure proof. The current study addresses this question by experimental work reproducing the malting processes and subsequent charring of the resulting products under laboratory conditions in order to simulate their preservation (by charring) in archaeological contexts and to explore the preservation of microstructural alterations of the cereal grains. The experimentally germinated and charred grains showed clearly degraded (thinned) aleurone cell walls. The histological alterations of the cereal grains were observed and quantified using reflected light and scanning electron microscopy and supported using morphometric and statistical analyses. In order to verify the experimental observations of histological alterations, amorphous charred objects (ACO) containing cereal remains originating from five archaeological sites dating to the 4th millennium BCE were considered: two sites were archaeologically recognisable brewing installations from Predynastic Egypt, while the three broadly contemporary central European lakeshore settlements lack specific contexts for their cereal-based food remains. The aleurone cell wall thinning known from food technological research and observed in our own experimental material was indeed also recorded in the archaeological finds. The Egyptian materials derive from beer production with certainty, supported by ample contextual and artefactual data. The Neolithic lakeshore settlement finds currently represent the oldest traces of malting in central Europe, while a bowl-shaped bread-like object from Hornstaad–Hörnle possibly even points towards early beer production in central Europe. One major further implication of our study is that the cell wall breakdown in the grain’s aleurone layer can be used as a general marker for malting processes with relevance to a wide range of charred archaeological finds of cereal products.","title":"Mashes to Mashes, Crust to Crust.

We used this method for archaeological soils. As a huge amount of M3 background data exists, it can be used for a wide spectrum of soils and enables extraction of many elements. Using M3 together with multivariate statistics, we demonstrated the range of questions that can be answered by analysing soils from a prehistoric barrow. In soil samples collected from different barrow layers and contemporary oak wood and arable soil controls, we determined pH, organic C and total N contents and M3 concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb. We used standardized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze the data.\n\nThe dark layer beneath the barrow represented the Chernozem soil present on the site before the construction of the barrow. Natural concentrations of elements in this paleosol indicate that the area was not used for settlement, metallurgy or pottery production activities before establishment of the barrow. Chernozems were probably more widespread in the lowland regions of Central Europe in the Late Neolithic than they are today. The fertility of the paleo-Chernozem was similar to contemporary arable soil. Soil horizons characteristic of Albeluvisols and the gradual increase in soil pH and Ca concentrations with depth indicated the natural character of the barrow layers. In oak wood, Albeluvisols develop over a period longer than a century, as indicated by missing characteristic horizons in the grave pit excavated a century ago. Recent wood and arable soils were more contaminated by Pb and Cd than the paleosol, indicating modern Pb and Cd deposition.\n\nM3 extraction can be used as an international standard method for analysis of archaeological soils. Analysis of soil properties enables many questions to be answered, and therefore it should be an integral part of any archaeological research effort.","title":"What questions can be answered by chemical analysis of recent and paleosols from the Bell Beaker barrow (2500–2200 BC), Central Moravia, Czech Republic?","creators":[{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Hejcman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kateřina","lastName":"Součková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Krištuf","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Peška","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Mähren"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Geoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Grabhügel"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Grabhügel_Wunnenstein"}],"dateAdded":"2021-12-15T15:59:24Z","dateModified":"2021-12-15T16:02:49Z","itemID":12626,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HejcmanEtAl2013WhatQuestions"},{"key":"PCQG89CX","version":2303,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Arch.

Applying the U–Pb technique to material within a time frame of interest to archaeology is a challenge only recently overcome, with enormous potential for future development and use. In terms of range, U–Th can generally date material of between a few years and as much as 600 ka, while U–Pb is best suited to material of 1 million years and older. U–Th dating is typically precise, with error margins of better than 1% routinely achievable for material of the last interglacial age or younger. Such precision is possible with U–Pb dating in the mid-Quaternary but most ages have uncertainties in the 5–10 % range. Carbonates are the most desirable U-series target material, with closed system behaviour being particularly important for U–Th dating; making inorganic deposits such as speleothems (secondary cave carbonates), tufa and calcrete ideal. Some biogenic carbonates such as coral and eggshell are often amenable to U-series dating, but less ideal material such as fossil teeth, bone and mollusc shell usually continue to gain uranium after deposition meaning accurate ages cannot be calculated. In all cases, the importance of a thorough understanding of the context of dated material cannot be overstated. In this contribution we review U–Th and U–Pb dating through an archaeological lens, focussing on the methods themselves; how to best interpret published data and how best to avoid common pitfalls. We highlight the major successes through a number of case studies and provide an overview of what we believe to be the future directions of this field.","title":"Recent advances and future prospects of the U–Th and U–Pb chronometers applicable to archaeology","creators":[{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Hellstrom","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robyn","lastName":"Pickering","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Datierung"},{"tag":"Uranium-Thorium-Datierung"},{"tag":"Uranium-Blei-Datierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:39Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:39Z","itemID":8477,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HellstromPickering2015RecentAdvances"},{"key":"BVV226ED","version":1975,"itemType":"book","date":"2000","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2713","title":"The Science and Archaeology of Materials","creators":[{"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Henderson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:38:18Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:38:18Z","itemID":3657,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Henderson2000ScienceArchaeology"},{"key":"S6HHV4MD","version":16700,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06335-6","rights":"2018 The Author(s)","volume":"9","issue":"1","pages":"4064","publicationTitle":"Nature Communications","ISSN":"2041-1723","date":"2018-10-03","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-06335-6","accessDate":"2022-12-08T08:42:39Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"The analysis of lipids (fats, oils and waxes) absorbed within archaeological pottery has revolutionized the study of past diets and culinary practices.

The aim was to identify a possible continuity in cult sites across the shift to Christianity in the late Viking Age. Charcoal samples from 18 mounds were radiocarbon dated but the results showed they were far older than expected. Control dating undertaken on burial mounds of known age confirmed that charcoal in the mound fill can at least be up to 3000 years older than the mound itself. As charcoal can survive in the surface soil layer for millennia, in spite of ploughing, bioturbation and frost, it may also dominate the charcoal pool of the grass or heather turfs used in the mound construction. Therefore, the article concludes, charcoal cannot be used to securely date archaeological features built with turfs and it is important to be aware of the possible presence of very old charcoal when selecting material for dating archaeological features, even those which otherwise would be judged unaffected by material from earlier archaeological periods.","title":"Dating Ancient Burial Mounds in Denmark – Revealing Problematic Ancient Charcoal","creators":[{"firstName":"Peter Steen","lastName":"Henriksen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sandie","lastName":"Holst","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henrik","lastName":"Breuning-Madsen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Holzkohle"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Grabhügel_Wunnenstein"}],"dateAdded":"2021-09-29T09:50:53Z","dateModified":"2021-09-29T09:50:53Z","itemID":11799,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HenriksenEtAl2019DatingAncient"},{"key":"8H48SLGC","version":2273,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"2011","pages":"37-40","publicationTitle":"Arch.

Yet the origins of Newgrange remain somewhat mysterious. Across Ireland over two hundred similar passage tombs are found, some of which are considerably older than Newgrange. These less investigated monuments reveal that the origins of Newgrange may be hidden in plain sight. A progression in the scale and sophistication of construction of these passage tombs, developments in the styles of megalithic art, and an increase in the scale and craftsmanship of associated artefacts may be observed, which taken together indicate a lengthy process of development. In short, Robert Hensey uncovers an untold history at Newgrange; an island-wide story of incremental changes over hundreds of years, of a society in evolution, perhaps in extremis, who left behind such a rich, enigmatic and patterned legacy.\n\nThis book not only charts the earlier history of Newgrange, but addresses why it was constructed, what was its purpose. In the Boyne Valley, through Newgrange and related sites at Brú na Bóinne, we have evidence not only of extraordinary physical accomplishments, but of tremendous acts of imagination; a testament to rich and developed inner worlds. In this book, it is proposed that the concept of an otherworld which could be embodied by and accessed through passage tombs was a central motivator in passage tomb construction from its earliest beginnings. Newgrange is at the end of a long tradition of monuments dedicated to the religious needs of Neolithic communities, from small-scale monuments built by early farming groups; to potent otherworld centres of ritual training at the edge of society; eventually to temple-like monuments standing at the very heart of the religious and political sphere in Neolithic Ireland.\n\nChallenging both orthodox archaeological opinions and popular conjecture, this will be an important book for anyone interested in Neolithic archaeology.","title":"First Light: The Origins of Newgrange","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hensey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Megalithik"},{"tag":"Irland"},{"tag":"Grabhügel"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:02Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:54:02Z","itemID":8607,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Hensey2015FirstLight"},{"key":"JZQEXZSW","version":2279,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"12, Sonderh.","publicationTitle":"Badische Fundber.","date":"1970","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6660","title":"Die Besiedlung der südlichen Oberrheinebene in Neolithikum und Frühbronzezeit","creators":[{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Hensler","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Süddeutschland"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:02:06Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:02:06Z","itemID":9983,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Hensler1970BesiedlungSudlichen"},{"key":"82M7SITD","version":1902,"itemType":"book","place":"Halle/Saale","date":"1961","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1929","title":"Die Steinäxte des Mittel- und Spätneolithikums im Elb-Saalegebiet und ihre kulturelle Zuweisung.

The aim is to assess pottery use during major changes in the coastal environment and in material culture. Bulk carbon and nitrogen isotope, lipid biomarker and compound specific carbon isotope analysis was undertaken on ‘foodcrusts’, charred deposits adhering to vessel surfaces, and absorbed residues from different vessel types. In addition, three archaeological seal bones were analysed for bulk collagen and compound specific carbon isotope analysis to establish collagen-lipid offsets to inform interpretation of the data. The results show that the majority of the vessels were used for processing aquatic products. At Nida the data suggest exploitation of freshwater resources and, in the later stages of occupation, dairying. Analysis of a small number of Subneolithic vessels from Šventoji produced results that are also consistent with processing of aquatic products.

However, the identi cation of plant remains, especially grain crops in pottery, has proved elusive. Extending the spectrum is highly desirable, not only to strengthen our understanding of the dispersal of crops from centres of domestication but also to determine modes of food processing, artefact function and the culinary signi cance of the crop. Here, we propose a new approach to identify millet in pottery vessels, a crop that spread throughout much of Eurasia during prehistory following its domestication, most likely in northern China. We report the successful identi cation of miliacin (olean-18-en-3β-ol methyl ether), a pentacyclic triterpene methyl ether that is enriched in grains of common/broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), in Bronze Age pottery vessels from the Korean Peninsula and northern Europe. The presence of millet is supported by enriched carbon stable isotope values of bulk charred organic matter sampled from pottery vessel surfaces and extracted n-alkanoic acids, consistent with a C4 plant origin. These data represent the  rst identi cation of millet in archaeological ceramic vessels, providing a means to track the introduction, spread and consumption of this important crop.","title":"First molecular and isotopic evidence of millet processing in prehistoric pottery vessels","creators":[{"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Heron","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Shoda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adrià Breu","lastName":"Barcons","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Czebreszuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yvette","lastName":"Eley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marise","lastName":"Gorton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wiebke","lastName":"Kirleis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jutta","lastName":"Kneisel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Lucquin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yastami","lastName":"Nishida","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joon-ho","lastName":"Son","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oliver E.","lastName":"Craig","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polen"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Befestigte Siedlung"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Gebrauchsspurenanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:03:44Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:03:44Z","itemID":10240,"notes":[],"citationKey":"HeronEtAl2018FirstMolecular"},{"key":"LNH9XTVR","version":5717,"itemType":"book","series":"Bodenaltertümer Westfalens","place":"Mainz","publisher":"von Zabern","ISBN":"978-3-8053-3969-8","date":"2009","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3683","seriesNumber":"48","title":"Die Gräber der frühen bis mittleren Bronzezeit in Westfalen.
