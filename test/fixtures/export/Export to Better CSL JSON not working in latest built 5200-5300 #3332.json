Most of the previous analyses, carried out in Calvados (Normandy) on Late Iron Age dwellings, suggested distinctive characteristics such as the increase of Avena (oat) and the abundance of pulses in storage pits. The collection of a new database with 25 sites was done in response to the previous lack of studies, which became an issue in Brittany, Normandy and the Loire region, which are known for their western location and trade links throughout Europe. This paper deals with farming practices and their changes during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The aim was to gather new evidence related to sowing times, tilling of fields and fertility management of soils in order to discuss extensive or intensive cultivation in northwestern France. The crop cultivation techniques were investigated by studying the weed flora composition according to the FIBS approach (Functional interpretation of botanical survey). The results reveal combinations of evidence and a pattern of intra-regional diversity.","title":"New insights into agriculture in northwestern France from the Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age: a weed ecological approach","shortTitle":"New insights into agriculture in northwestern France from the Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age","creators":[{"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Neveu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Véronique","lastName":"Zech-Matterne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cécile","lastName":"Brun","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie-France","lastName":"Dietsch-Sellami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frédérique","lastName":"Durand","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Françoise","lastName":"Toulemonde","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Kulturlandschaft"},{"tag":"Landschaftsentwicklung"},{"tag":"Agrarlandschaft"},{"tag":"Agriculture","type":1},{"tag":"Bronze Age","type":1},{"tag":"Crop regime","type":1},{"tag":"Iron Age","type":1},{"tag":"Northwestern France","type":1},{"tag":"Weed flora","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-13T18:22:44Z","dateModified":"2023-09-13T18:22:44Z","itemID":31318,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NeveuEtAl2021NewInsights"},{"key":"KG6WFN7P","version":1989,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Archeologické Vyskumy a Nalezy na Slovensku v Roku 1983, 156-158","date":"1984","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2878","title":"Predbežné výsledky predstihového záchranného výskumu v Bajči-Vlkanove","creators":[{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Nevizánsky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Točik","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:38:44Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:38:44Z","itemID":4021,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NevizanskyTocik1984PredbezneVysledky"},{"key":"W9DD28DY","version":5735,"itemType":"book","series":"Tübinger Arbeiten zur Urgesch.","place":"Rahden/Westf.","publisher":"Leidorf","date":"2009","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3849","seriesNumber":"5","title":"Die Schwäbische Alb in der späteren Steinzeit.

Forensic anthropological investigation identified three distinctive bone defects, the surfaces of which were macromorphologically and microscopically examined in greater detail.

These artefacts are examined from the angle of typology, raw materials, technology, experimentation and use-wear. The aim of these different approaches is to characterize the modes of production and the functions of stone arrowheads during a period which successively sees the introduction of copper then bronze metallurgy.\nSeveral interpretations are proposed, from warriors renewing their quivers to craftsmen manufacturing prestige goods for the elite. In Brittany, the arrows are set in their cultural and social context, marked by an individualization of funerary practices and then by the emergence of chiefs at the head of strongly hierarchical communities with geographically coherent territories. Power seems founded on reorganization of land-use and exploitation of agricultural resources, rather than on control of incipient metallurgy. Lastly, arrows are placed in the broader perspective of major trends affecting Atlantic Europe. The origin of the squared-off barbed and tanged arrowheads of the Bell Beaker culture seems anchored in the Final Neolithic of west-central France, while in the Early Bronze Age the arrowheads with oblique barbs seem to indicate an attachment to the Atlantic cultural complex.","title":"Flèches de pouvoir à l’aube de la métallurgie de la Bretagne au Danemark (2500-1700 av. n. è.)","creators":[{"firstName":"Clément","lastName":"Nicolas","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Pfeil & Bogen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:57:48Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:57:48Z","itemID":9397,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Nicolas2016FlechesPouvoir"},{"key":"S9TQMN8I","version":26258,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://www.sidestone.com/books/habitus","series":"Scales of Transformation","place":"Leiden","publisher":"Sidestone","pages":"115-139","ISBN":"978-90-8890-783-8","date":"2019/09/02","accessDate":"2024-02-21T10:53:18Z","seriesNumber":"3","libraryCatalog":"www.sidestone.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"Dates ranging from 2500 to 1700 BCE are a period of major social and economic change in western and central Europe, with the spreading of the Bell Beaker Culture and the introduction or the development of metalworking (copper then bronze). At that time, archery-related items became peculiarly significant for the Bell Beaker and some Early Bronze Age communities. They include especially specific types of arrowheads and an original item, the stone bracer, thought to have adorned organic wristguards. Technological studies point to the objects that were more or less easily made during the Bell Beaker period, suggesting that each warrior was able to shape his own set, while during the Early Bronze Age, the level of know-how as well the context of production suggests that these items were manufactured by craftsmen for the elite. Use-wear analysis shows that these objects might be commonly worn. During the Bell Beaker period, part of the arrowhead and, to a lesser extent, some bracers were used for shooting. However, in some regions during the Early Bronze Age, these objects were intended for display only. These two types of production and uses of archery-related items illustrate a shift from the object-signs of the Bell Beaker warriors towards items alienated from their primary function or sacred objects of the Early Bronze Age elites. Finally, the wide distribution of Bell Beaker arrowheads and bracers allow considering the relevance of the circulation of ideas, objects and individuals in adopting a European fashion.","title":"The production and use of archery-related items as a reflection of social changes during the Late Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age in Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Clément","lastName":"Nicolas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kadrow","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Krieger"},{"tag":"Pfeilspitzen"},{"tag":"Armschutzplatten"},{"tag":"Bogenschütze"},{"tag":"Pfeil & Bogen"},{"tag":"Gebrauchsspurenanalyse"},{"tag":"Silexpfeilspitze"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:14Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:53:57Z","itemID":31848,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Nicolas2019ProductionUse","publicationTitle":"Habitus?.

A recent re-examination of the Saint-Bélec slab suggests that its sculptured surface and scattered motifs represent the surrounding landscape and a series of contemporary structures now known from archaeological evidence. When discovered, the slab formed the western side of one of the largest stone-cists in the region. It was orientated east-west and measured 3.86 m long, 2.1 m wide, and 1.86 m high (fig. 3). However, at the time of its excavation, the slab was partly broken, presumably in antiquity, with the upper part missing. It was surmounted by several layers of rubble stone (fig. 3, no. 6). Within the grave, was a broken ceramic vessel, now lost but characteristic of early Bronze Age pottery. The study of the slab was conducted using whole slab observations, general and detailed photographs with oblique lighting, and several 3D survey methods (photogrammetry, general and high definition 3D-scanning) to record the surface topography of the slab at different scales and to analyse the morphology, technology, and chronology of the engravings (tabl. 1, fig. 5 and 6). The generation of a 3D-Digital Elevation Map from high definition 3D-scanning and various visualisation techniques was the basis for subsequent interpretation and analysis (fig. 7 and 8). The slab is a grey-blue coloured schist, c. 2.2 m long, 1.53 m wide and 0.16 m thick. Under polarized light, the groundmass appears to be typical of the Douarnenez Phyllade series that form locally the bedrock in the Saint-Bélec area (fig. 4). All the engravings are relatively fresh and show no trace of weathering (fig. 8, no. 1 and 2), although they have suffered biological, chemical and mechanical alterations in recent times (fig. 9). This suggests that the carved slab was not exposed in the open air for long. The motifs cut into the surface are relatively uniform and show simple geometric shapes: i.e. round and oval cup-marks; straight or curved lines; and squares, circles, ovals or curved shapes (fig. 10). Some associations between motifs appear to form recurrent patterns, for example one or more cup-marks included in a closed shape, and cup-marks at line ends or intersections. One of the peculiarities of the Saint-Bélec slab is its sculptured surface. A triangular hollow has been carved out from the centre to the left-hand end. Its upper and lower edges have been shaped by two deep-pecked bas-reliefs (B1, B2/B3), the lower one having been split and cemented together in recent times (fig. 11). In between, the surface was variously weathered or freshly flaked by pecking related to superimposed motifs, suggesting that the triangular hollow probably took advantage of a pre-existing depression in the surface of the slab (fig. 8, no. 1). While there are relatively few blank areas on the decorated surface, there is very little overlap of the motifs, except at their ends. Therefore, it appears that the successive phases in creating the panel did not significantly change the overall composition but were rather added in a planned way (tabl. 2 and fig. 11). The main issue about the dating of the Saint-Bélec slab is its probable re-use. Stylistically, the motifs are quite different from those found in the regional Neolithic traditions of ???megalithic??? art. This is supported by the freshness of the engravings which implies a relatively short time-span between their creation and the subsequent burial of the slab. The most spectacular characteristic of the Saint-Bélec slab is its map-like pattern that consists of a homogeneous composition of repeated motifs joined by a series of lines. Comparisons with other similar representations from prehistoric times in Europe and elsewhere in the world show that they are commonly regarded as plan topographical maps (fig. 12 and 13); a hypothesis which is further supported as well by ethnographic data (fig. 14 to 16). A key point is that the engravers seem to have modified the original surface relief of the slab to create the desired 3D-form that compares to the topography of the surrounding landscape, the upper Odet River valley, overlooked by the Saint-Bélec barrow (fig. 17, no. 1 and 2). Furthermore, a series of lines appear to figure a more extended river network (fig. 17, no. 3 and 4). To test this hypothesis, we have led several network and shape analyses that confirm a good correspondence between the carvings and the topography (fig. 18), with similar results to ethnographic solicited maps (fig. 19). Such correlations give the opportunity to georeferenced the Saint-Bélec slab and get an idea of the possible scale of the space represented: an area c. 30 km long and 21 km wide (fig. 17, no. 5). Furthermore, the carved motifs might have depicted early Bronze Age settlements, barrows, field systems, and tracks (fig. 20, no. 1 and 2, 21 and 22). The early Bronze Age in Brittany is well known for its princely burials (fig. 23) which are regularly distributed in western Brittany and are assumed to reflect the centres of established territories that can be modelled using Thiessen Polygons. Although no such burial is known in the area, the central motif on the Saint-Bélec slab could be interpreted as a central place of an early Bronze Age territory, extending over an area of 545 to 843 sq. km (fig. 20, no. 3 and 4). One outstanding question about the Saint-Bélec slab is why it was made? One possibility is that such a territorial depiction was a material and symbolic act enforcing.

Previous analyses of phosphorus from Danish Celtic fields show that manuring was carried out at most sites, but due to methodological issues and representativity biases, these results have been difficult to compare and interpret. In this study, samples from three well-preserved field systems in eastern Jutland, Denmark, were analysed with the purpose of investigating the manuring regime. We focused on identifying possible variations between and, in particular, within the individual sites. The main method used was multi-element analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which was supplemented by soil thin section analysis and analysis of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs). Evidence of animal manure and household waste was found at all three sites and, additionally, material from wetlands was identified at one site. Clear variations between individual fields were identified, which stress the importance of taking composite samples from a large number of fields in order to obtain a more complex understanding of the manuring practices within field systems. Manuring intensity was generally low, indicating a rather extensive use of the field systems in Southern Scandinavia in the Early Iron Age.","title":"Low and variable: Manuring intensity in Danish Celtic fields","shortTitle":"Low and variable","creators":[{"firstName":"Nina H.","lastName":"Nielsen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Søren M.","lastName":"Kristiansen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ljungberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Renée","lastName":"Enevold","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mette","lastName":"Løvschal","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Dänemark"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"celtic fields"},{"tag":"Früheisenzeit"},{"tag":"Landwirtschaft"},{"tag":"Tierhaltung"},{"tag":"Geoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Jütland"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Grabhügel_Wunnenstein"},{"tag":"Dünung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-09-22T10:46:14Z","dateModified":"2021-11-19T12:35:19Z","itemID":11780,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NielsenEtAl2019LowVariable"},{"key":"7BAFIDKR","version":2323,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"105166","publicationTitle":"Journal of Archaeological Science","ISSN":"0305-4403","date":"2020/06/25/","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7148","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.105166","abstractNote":"Since the 18 th century, the peat bogs of Northern Europe have yielded the remains of hundreds of people dating from as far back as c. 8.000 BC. While the individuals with preserved soft tissue have been subjected to numerous and comprehensive studies, the less famous bog skeletons have received much less attention, even though the distinction is essentially attributable solely to differences in preservation conditions. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by providing valuable information on ten bog skeletons from the small region of Vesthimmerland in northwest Denmark. The large majority (nine out of ten) of these finds are previously unpublished. We.apply a cross-disciplinary approach consisting of osteological and paleopathological investigations combined with radiocarbon and strontium isotope analyses. Our radiocarbon results show that two of the ten bog skeletons (two adult females) date to the Nordic Neolithic Age, one 8-year old child dates to the Nordic Bronze Age, while the majority are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age and Roman Iron Age (one child, four adult females and two adult males). Anthropological examination suggested no evidence of peri-mortem violence, but the finding of gross pathologies in two individuals could hint at deliberate deposition in the bog. Nine individuals yielded strontium isotopic values suggesting a local origin, whereas a female dating to the Pre- Roman Iron Age yielded highly radiogenic signatures suggesting a non-local origin. These results represent the first cross-disciplinary study of numerous bog skeletons adding much needed information to a neglected group of individuals, shedding new light on the different theories for the deposition of human remains in bogs in prehistoric times.","title":"New insights from forgotten bog bodies: The potential of bog skeletons for investigating the phenomenon of deposition of human remains in bogs during prehistory","creators":[{"firstName":"Bjarne Henning","lastName":"Nielsen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tina","lastName":"Christensen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karin Margarita","lastName":"Frei","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Dänemark"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Gewalt"},{"tag":"Nordische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"},{"tag":"Sonderbestattung"},{"tag":"Moorleiche"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:44Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:44Z","itemID":10847,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NielsenEtAl2020NewInsights"},{"key":"YHWBHZ6X","version":8817,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"89","issue":"1","pages":"15-29","publicationTitle":"Acta Archaeologica","ISSN":"0065-101X","date":"2018","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7172","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0390.2018.12190.x","abstractNote":"Klavs Randsborg has made important contributions to the archaeology of the Bronze Age and later prehistoric periods, but in the 1970s he also touched upon issues such as the formation of rank in Neolithic societies. In his article ‘Social Dimensions of Early Neolithic Denmark’, he suggested that a hierarchical society arose at the transition from the Early to Middle Neolithic, c. 3300–3200 BC. Since then, excavations and research have resulted in numerous publications about the Neolithic, but only rarely have these examined social development. In this article, the authors continue the debate, sharing the same starting point as Klavs Randsborg, but here approaching the question of emerging social inequality on the background of recent research into the early agricultural societies in Northern Europe, seen in a broader European context. The primary focus is upon burial monuments as manifestations of status and power, and parallels are drawn with similar construction activities amongst present-day farming communities in such remote areas as the islands of Southeast Asia. The social organisation and ritual customs of these modern farming communities are considered relevant when interpreting the archaeological evidence for early agricultural societies in Northern Europe.","title":"The Formation of Social Rank in the Early Neolithic of Northern Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Poul Otto","lastName":"Nielsen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lasse","lastName":"Sørensen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:59Z","dateModified":"2021-10-28T08:11:40Z","itemID":10905,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NielsenSorensen2018FormationSocial"},{"key":"SYIY3DI6","version":4024,"itemType":"book","date":"1997","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2120","title":"C14-Crash:…","creators":[{"firstName":"H.-U.","lastName":"Niemitz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"14C-Datierung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:36:40Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:36:40Z","itemID":2764,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Niemitz1997C14Crash"},{"key":"C7NEZ7RD","version":4073,"itemType":"book","date":"1966","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2121","title":"Das swebische Gräberfeld von Diersheim.

PCCTC farmers interacted with Eneolithic forager-pastoralist groups of the North Pontic steppe as PCCTC extended from the Carpathian foothills to the Dnipro Valley beginning in the late 5th millennium BCE. While the cultural interaction between the two groups is evident through the Cucuteni C pottery style that carries steppe influence, the extent of biological interactions between Trypillian farmers and the steppe remains unclear. Here we report the analysis of artefacts from the late 5th millennium Trypillian settlement at the Kolomiytsiv Yar Tract (KYT) archaeological complex in central Ukraine, focusing on a human bone fragment found in the Trypillian context at KYT. Diet stable isotope ratios obtained from the bone fragment suggest the diet of the KYT individual to be within the range of forager-pastoralists of the North Pontic area. Strontium isotope ratios of the KYT individual are consistent with having originated from contexts of the Serednii Stih (Sredny Stog) culture sites of the Middle Dnipro Valley. Genetic analysis of the KYT individual indicates ancestry derived from a proto-Yamna population such as Serednii Stih. Overall, the KYT archaeological site presents evidence of interactions between Trypillians and Eneolithic Pontic steppe inhabitants of the Serednii Stih horizon and suggests a potential for gene flow between the two groups as early as the beginning of the 4th millennium BCE.","title":"Interactions between Trypillian farmers and North Pontic forager-pastoralists in Eneolithic central Ukraine","creators":[{"firstName":"Alexey G.","lastName":"Nikitin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mykhailo","lastName":"Videiko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Patterson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Virginie","lastName":"Renson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Osteuropa"},{"tag":"Ukraine"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Cucuteni Kultur"},{"tag":"Archaeology","type":1},{"tag":"Ceramics","type":1},{"tag":"Culture","type":1},{"tag":"Diet","type":1},{"tag":"Paleopedology","type":1},{"tag":"Stable isotopes","type":1},{"tag":"Strontium","type":1},{"tag":"Valleys","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2023-06-22T05:41:43Z","dateModified":"2023-06-22T05:41:43Z","itemID":31164,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NikitinEtAl2023InteractionsTrypillian"},{"key":"DNJDJ2CI","version":24317,"itemType":"preprint","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.17.589600v1","rights":"© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We report genome-wide data from 78 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of the people involved in these migrations and discover the reasons for their success. First, we show that native North Pontic foragers had ancestry not only from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 but also from European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. More dramatic inflows ensued during the Eneolithic, when migrants from the Caucasus-Lower Volga area7 moved westward, bypassing the local foragers to mix with Trypillian farmers advancing eastward. People of the Usatove archaeological group in the Northwest Pontic were formed ca. 4500 BCE with an equal measure of ancestry from the two expanding groups. A different Caucasus-Lower Volga group, moving westward in a distinct but temporally overlapping wave, avoided the farmers altogether, and blended with the foragers instead to form the people of the Serednii Stih archaeological complex7. A third wave of expansion occurred when Yamna descendants of the Serednii Stih forming ca. 4000 BCE expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 BCE). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna expansion is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka in Ukraine (3635-3383 BCE), a site of uninterrupted archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic-Bronze Age transition, and the likely epicenter of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders during its advance, a flexible strategy forged in the North Pontic region that may explain its peoples’ outsized success in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3–5,8–10.","title":"A genomic history of the North Pontic Region from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age","creators":[{"firstName":"Alexey G.","lastName":"Nikitin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iosif","lastName":"Lazaridis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Patterson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Svitlana","lastName":"Ivanova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mykhailo","lastName":"Videiko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Dergachev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadiia","lastName":"Kotova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Malcolm","lastName":"Lillie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Inna","lastName":"Potekhina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Krenz-Niedbała","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sylwia","lastName":"Łukasik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Serhij","lastName":"Makhortykh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Virginie","lastName":"Renson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Shephard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gennadie","lastName":"Sirbu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sofiia","lastName":"Svyryd","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Taras","lastName":"Tkachuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Włodarczak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Callan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Curtis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eadaoin","lastName":"Harney","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lora","lastName":"Iliev","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aisling","lastName":"Kearns","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ann Marie","lastName":"Lawson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Michel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Mah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Micco","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Oppenheimer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Qiu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

The people took part in a broad spectrum of activities: hunting, gathering, fishing, agriculture, animal husbandry, and artisan crafts. They maintained their regional traditions while dwelling on the edge of this Neolithic cultural group. The study depicts Neolithic households as highly mobile with sedentary and seasonal settlements. The patterns that emerge from the in-depth spatial analysis of material distributions indicate the presence of spatially bound locations for specific activities. This structuring of space further supports the identification of various dwelling structures. Neolithic monumentality is, for the first time, identified within the Dutch coastal wetlands.

The lack of systematic programmes to analyse such archaeological gold finds has led them to being identified as ornamental finds, of undetermined chronology, linked to a simple manufacturing technology of hammering gold nuggets of an uncertain origin or from the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as items with a purely symbolic or ‘prestige’ value in the funerary practices of simple group-oriented or collaborative chiefdoms. But however, the first documentation, radiocarbon dating and systematic analysis of these products in settlement contexts has altered this interpretation.\n\nThe presence of gold manufactures during the third quarter of the 3rd Millennium BC (c. 2500–2350 cal. BC) in the contexts of a settlement specialised in copper production such as Cabezo Juré, in the South-western mining region (Huelva, Spain), and in the contexts of a huge central site such as Valencina de la Concepción, in the agrarian region of the Lower Guadalquivir Basin (Seville, Spain), points to the widespread social use of gold in the period of maximum expression of the inter-settlement hierarchisation in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, its link with the social spaces of inequality expression and their relationship with a complex production system. Geochemical characterization by LA-ICP-MS, lead isotopes analysis by MC-ICP-MS and metallographic study suggest two differentiated and independent supplies of raw material systems (fluvial placers vs. mines and local vs. regional scale), with at least four source areas, the regional circulation of raw material or products and a manufacturing by a metallurgical technology linked to the copper production.","title":"Gold in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula during the 3rd Millennium BC","creators":[{"firstName":"F.","lastName":"Nocete","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R.","lastName":"Sáez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.R.","lastName":"Bayona","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.M.","lastName":"Nieto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Peramo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"López","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.I.","lastName":"Gil-Ibarguchi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"N.","lastName":"Inácio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"García","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Rodríguez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Bleiisotopie"},{"tag":"Goldfunde"},{"tag":"Lead isotopes"}],"dateAdded":"2022-03-02T15:08:46Z","dateModified":"2022-03-02T15:10:04Z","itemID":12794,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NoceteEtAl2014GoldSouthwest"},{"key":"24SWFFNW","version":4757,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14655187.2019.1762151","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"1-24","publicationTitle":"Public Archaeology","ISSN":"1465-5187","date":"July 27, 2020","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7315","DOI":"10.1080/14655187.2019.1762151","accessDate":"2020-07-29T09:25:54Z","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstractNote":"As material reflections of human identity and behaviour, heritage assets are often viewed as a source of belonging and existential awareness. In recent years, these impacts have been shown to promote personal wellbeing in ways which align with the therapeutic concept of existential relatedness. Defined as a feeling of deep connection to something greater than the self, existential relatedness has been identified as a fundamental component of personal wellbeing. In light of findings from qualitative work undertaken in the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site (WHS) and the Vale of Pewsey, Wiltshire, UK, and their environs, this paper considers the capacity for these prehistoric landscapes to facilitate a sense of existential relatedness for people in the present. As a result of this exploration, it suggests that, in certain contexts, the historic environment has a unique role to play in the creation of existential wellbeing through the cultural, collective and transcendent connections that it affords. The paper further theorizes that the feeling of connectivity which many people experience in response to heritage assets is essentially a form of communitas, and perhaps one of the greatest social benefits that the historic environment has to offer.","title":"Sites of Existential Relatedness: Findings from Phenomenological Research at Stonehenge, Avebury and the Vale of Pewsey, Wiltshire, UK","shortTitle":"Sites of Existential Relatedness","creators":[{"firstName":"Claire","lastName":"Nolan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Stonehenge"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"communitas"},{"tag":"henge monuments"},{"tag":"Soziale Identität"}],"dateAdded":"2020-07-29T09:25:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T11:04:37Z","itemID":384,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Nolan2020SitesExistential"},{"key":"TPM6J7YJ","version":3814,"itemType":"book","series":"Universitätsforsch.

Zunächst wurde die Geschlechterverteilung bei Lage, Ausrichtung und Beigabenverteilung betrachtet, von denen nur die letzte klare Unterschiede ergab: In der frühen LBK sind reiche Bestattungen noch gleich verteilt, in der mittleren und späten LBK erhalten Männer immer mehr Beigaben, Frauen weniger. Besondere Beigaben wie Spondylus und Dechsel sind verschieden häufig und anfangs geschlechtsunabhängig, Dechsel später zunehmend bei Männern zu finden. Auch pathologische Auffälligkeiten nehmen allmählich zu, sind aber wenig geschlechtsspezifisch; nur Schmelzhypoplasien als Zeichen von Mangelernährung häufen sich bei Frauen.

Within that complex, it represents its eastern expansion to the catchment of the Upper and Middle Volga River in the European part of Russia. Its immediate roots are to be found in the southern Baltic States, Belarus, and northern Ukraine (the Baltic and Middle-Dnepr Corded Ware Cultures), from where moving people spread the culture further east along the river valleys of the forested flatlands. By doing so, they introduced animal husbandry to these regions. Fatyanovo Culture is predominately recognised through its material culture imbedded in its mortuary practices. Most aspects of every-day life remain unknown. The lack of an adequate absolute chronological framework has thus far prevented the verification of its internal cultural dynamics while overall interaction proposed also on typo-stratigraphical grounds suggests a contemporaneity with other representations of the Corded Ware Complex in Europe. Fatyanovo Culture is formed by the reverse movement to the (north-)east of the Corded Ware Complex, itself established in the aftermath of the westbound spread of Yamnaya populations from the steppes. It thus represents an important link between west and east, pastoralists and last hunter-gatherers, and the 3rd and the 2nd millennia bc. Through its descendants (including Abashevo, Sintashta, and Andronovo Cultures) it becomes a key component in the development of the wider cultural landscape of Bronze Age Eurasia.","title":"The Forgotten Child of the Wider Corded Ware Family: Russian Fatyanovo Culture in Context","shortTitle":"The Forgotten Child of the Wider Corded Ware Family","creators":[{"firstName":"Kerkko","lastName":"Nordqvist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Heyd","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Osteuropa"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Russland"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Migration"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Yamnaja Kultur"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"},{"tag":"Fatyanovo Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2025-01-31T19:41:53Z","dateModified":"2025-02-04T10:44:07Z","itemID":33031,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NordqvistHeyd2020ForgottenChild"},{"key":"KRVYAHY5","version":8574,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Lund Arch.

Results from the corrosion crust of copper-tin alloys, and the change measured within the elemental composition from the bulk metal to the surface, greatly influenced the interpretation of the second data set, which was measured using a handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) device. The surface of corroded bronze ornaments consists mostly of copper carbonates, oxides, and chlorides. Chemical processes, such as decuprification, change the element composition in such a manner that the original alloy cannot be traced with a non-destructive method.

The crucial turning point for the development of the NBA can be pinpointed as the second phase of the Late Neolithic (LN II, c. 2000–1700 BC) precisely because the availability and use of metal increased markedly at this time. But the precise provenance of copper reaching Scandinavia in the early second millennium is still unclear and our knowledge about the driving force leading to the establishment of the Bronze Age in southern Scandinavia is fragmentary and incomplete. This study, drawing on a large data set of 210 samples representing almost 50% of all existing metal objects known from this period in Denmark, uses trace element (EDXRF) and isotope analyses (MC-ICP-MS) of copper-based artifacts in combination with substantial typological knowledge to profoundly illuminate the contact directions, networks and routes of the earliest metal supplies. It also presents the first investigation of local recycling or mixing of metals originating from different ore regions. Both continuity and change emerge clearly in the metal-trading networks of the Late Neolithic to the first Bronze Age period. Artifacts in LN II consist mainly of high-impurity copper (so-called fahlore type copper), with the clear exception of British imports. Targeted reuse of foreign artifacts in local production is demonstrated by the presence of British metal in local-style axes. The much smaller range of lead isotope ratios among locally crafted compared to imported artifacts is also likely due to mixing. In the latter half of Nordic LN II (1800–1700 BC), the first signs emerge of a new and distinct type of copper with low impurity levels, which gains enormously in importance later in NBA IA.","title":"On the trail of Scandinavia’s early metallurgy: Provenance, transfer and mixing","shortTitle":"On the trail of Scandinavia’s early metallurgy","creators":[{"firstName":"Heide W.","lastName":"Nørgaard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"_tag_nachtragen"},{"tag":"Copper","type":1},{"tag":"Isotopes","type":1},{"tag":"Metallic lead","type":1},{"tag":"Valleys","type":1},{"tag":"Data mining","type":1},{"tag":"Slovakian people","type":1},{"tag":"Trace elements","type":1},{"tag":"Tin","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-26T07:11:15Z","dateModified":"2023-09-26T07:11:15Z","itemID":31349,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NorgaardEtAl2019TrailScandinavia"},{"key":"BBYLXL3V","version":26254,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252376","volume":"16","issue":"6","pages":"e0252376","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"16 Jun 2021","journalAbbreviation":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0252376","accessDate":"2023-09-26T07:12:45Z","libraryCatalog":"PLoS Journals","abstractNote":"Based on 550 metal analyses, this study sheds decisive light on how the Nordic Bronze Age was founded on metal imports from shifting ore sources associated with altered trade routes. On-and-off presence of copper characterised the Neolithic. At 2100–2000 BC, a continuous rise in the flow of metals to southern Scandinavia begins. First to arrive via the central German Únětician hubs was high-impurity metal from the Austrian Inn Valley and Slovakia; this was complemented by high-tin British metal, enabling early local production of tin bronzes. Increased metal use locally fuelled the leadership competitions visible in the metal-led material culture. The Únětice downfall c.1600 BC resulted for a short period in a raw materials shortage, visible in the reuse of existing stocks, but stimulated direct Nordic access to the Carpathian basin. This new access expedited innovations in metalwork with reliance on chalcopyrite from Slovakia, as well as opening new sources in the eastern Alps, along an eastern route that also conveyed Baltic amber as far as the Aegean. British metal plays a central role during this period. Finally, from c.1500 BC, when British copper imports ceased, the predominance of novel northern Italian copper coincides with the full establishment of the NBA and highlights a western route, connecting the NBA with the southern German Tumulus culture and the first transalpine amber traffic.","title":"Shifting networks and mixing metals: Changing metal trade routes to Scandinavia correlate with Neolithic and Bronze Age transformations","shortTitle":"Shifting networks and mixing metals","creators":[{"firstName":"Heide W.","lastName":"Nørgaard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Metallanalyse"},{"tag":"Hügelgräberkultur"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Nordische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Kupferbergbau"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"},{"tag":"Alpenraum"},{"tag":"_tag_nachtragen"},{"tag":"Neolithic period","type":1},{"tag":"Copper","type":1},{"tag":"Isotopes","type":1},{"tag":"Metallic lead","type":1},{"tag":"Data mining","type":1},{"tag":"Italian people","type":1},{"tag":"Slovakian people","type":1},{"tag":"Trace elements","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-24T08:49:14Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:52:47Z","itemID":31348,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NorgaardEtAl2021ShiftingNetworks"},{"key":"7I2XQBIW","version":24725,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://brill.com/view/journals/acar/92/2/article-p121_3.xml","volume":"92","issue":"2","pages":"121-163","publicationTitle":"Acta Archaeologica","ISSN":"0065-101X, 1600-0390","date":"2023-04-14","extra":"Publisher: Brill","DOI":"10.1163/16000390-20210036","accessDate":"2024-07-04T06:43:16Z","libraryCatalog":"brill.com","language":"eng","abstractNote":"Abstract This article presents the results of a comprehensive investigation of Fårdrup and Valsømagle-type shafthole axes from Denmark and southern Sweden. The combination of artefact style and typology with trace element and lead isotope data in the analysis has provided new insights into the chronological relationship between these two axe types. This way, we open a new window to long-standing debates surrounding these artefact types. Did Fårdrup and Valsømagle type axes evolve parallel, or did they replace each other chronologically in evolutionary progression? The archaeometallurgical dataset presented in this article includes more than 70 axes. Four axes have been analysed for this article. This large set of data is then assessed against a background of metal analyses which trace the long and winding evolution of the use of bronze in Scandinavia c.2300–1400 BC. Combining these two datasets shows the provenance of the metals and, thus, provides insights into metallurgical developments at the onset of the Nordic Bronze Age (NBA, c.1600 BC). In particular, the shafthole axes offer new evidence of the use of a novel type of copper from the East Alpine region based on chalcopyrite ores. The first occurrences of this low-impurity copper in southern Scandinavia appeared around 1700 BC. However, it would eventually become dominant in c.1600 BC, when the local production of shafthole axes began. Significantly, a fraction of the shafthole axes – Fårdrup and Valsømagle-types alike – consist of low impurity copper most likely derived from the Italian Alps (Trentino), which was absent in earlier periods. By NBA II 1500–1300 BC, most metal objects can be related to this northern Italian copper. We interpret this in terms of chronology: Fårdrup (⁓Koszider) and Valsømagle (⁓Tumulus B1) consisted of similar types of copper, which had declined by the onset of NBA II, all indicating that Fårdrup and Valsømagle style objects flourished before the beginning of NBA II (c.1500 BC). The small influx of north Italian copper in the axes indicates that its arrival began before the breakthrough of NBA II. Therefore, while the results of the metal analyses cannot exclude chronological differences between the two shafthole axe types over the 16th century BC, it is probable that their timelines coincided. In summary, our results display correlations between societal developments and thresholds on the one hand and metal provenances and trade routes on the other.","title":"1600 BC: Fårdrup and Valsømagle-Type Axes and the First Evidence of Southern Alpine Metal","shortTitle":"1600 BC","creators":[{"firstName":"Heide W.","lastName":"Nørgaard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Metallanalyse"},{"tag":"Rohstoffquellen"},{"tag":"Nordische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Metallhandwerk"},{"tag":"Äxte"}],"dateAdded":"2024-07-04T06:43:16Z","dateModified":"2024-07-04T06:44:13Z","itemID":32302,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NorgaardEtAl20231600BC"},{"key":"EPXTSFA8","version":27283,"itemType":"book","publisher":"Archaeopress Archaeology","date":"2025-01","title":"Bronzization.

We aim for verification of the existing findings in this matter, with particular attention devoted to microscopic damage (microcrush-outs, polish and striations). The list of traces characteristic for projectile points is formed mainly basing on morphology (current microscopic observations) and only indirectly on functional classification. In the course of our experiment 122 arrowhead replicas were used: 33 points, 31 arrowheads with bifacial surface retouch, 26 trapezes and 16 composite arrowheads (made of a lateral inset/barb and point inset each). Our classification includes 22 diagnostic features, divided into 4 main groups: fractures, retouching, polish and striations. Among fractures most characteristic were the complex splintered ones as well as certain types of fractures with retouch (especially those with spin-off spalls). Among the retouched ones and crush-outs the most abundant ones exhibited microburin and spin-off spalls, though retouches such as: toothed, splintered, post-impact and splintered near the holder were considered as important, too. Attention was also paid to slanting edge retouch, which is not found on other types of functional tools. Among different types of polish special attention was given to those formed as a result of a tool’s rapid friction against a hard material at the point of impact. Prime importance was given to patch-like and linear polish; large significance was also given to specific types of ridge and edge polish. Linear traces were found to be of little use for the interpretation of a missile weapon’s insets function. Our observations suggest that the identification of prehistoric projectile points may require a much more precise analysis than those hitherto conducted. Relying solely on the basic types of post-impact traces is inadequate. Traces of this type are in fact only present on a small percentage of the total number of insets. In addition, some kinds of them formed only in specific circumstances, in which both the type of arrowhead and the kind of target were of importance. Information obtained through the experiment and use wear research was used for the analysis of archaeologically obtained arrowhead insets. These are dated from Late Paleolithic to Early Bronze.","title":"Krzemienne zbrojniki broni miotanej z ziemi chełmińskiej w świetle analiz traseologicznych i badań eksperymentalnych","creators":[{"firstName":"Dorota","lastName":"Nowak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Osipowicz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Pfeilspitzen"},{"tag":"Flint"},{"tag":"Pfeil & Bogen"},{"tag":"Gebrauchsspurenanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:13Z","itemID":8319,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NowakOsipowicz2012KrzemienneZbrojniki"},{"key":"QYQPFF8U","version":8349,"itemType":"book","series":"Via Archaeologica","place":"Kraków","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6015","title":"The Baden culture around the Western Carpathians","creators":[{"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Nowak","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Zastawny","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polen"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Badener Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:26Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T11:05:36Z","itemID":8703,"notes":[{"key":"QQX6DSYQ","version":2672,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"QYQPFF8U","note":"<p>TOC<br/>Marek Nowak, Albert Zastawny<br/>Preface <br/>Janusz K.

Altogether 61 Early Bronze Age (EBA) gold objects dating between 2500 and 2000 BCE were investigated in this study. They were primarily sampled with a portable laser ablation (pLA) unit in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens and analyzed with ICP-MS at the Curt-Engelhorn-Centre Archaeometry (CEZA) in Mannheim. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility to obtain samples on site without the necessity of transport. It is a minimally invasive method that leaves no visible damage on the objects. As an additional advantage there are no restrictions on the size of the objects under study. The central goal of the study was to obtain high-quality compositional analyses of gold objects from the sites Troy and Poliochni to investigate, if the typological similarity is paralleled by the elemental composition of the gold, including the trace elements. This would suggest not only similar procurement of the metal across these sites but also potential exchange of objects and/or specialist workers. In a second step, the results were compared with data from contemporary gold objects from Ur in southern Mesopotamia, from where LA-ICP-MS data have recently become available. Finally, a survey of such data for gold objects from gold-rich regions is used to narrow down the possible origin of Early Bronze Age gold in the Old World.","title":"Portable laser ablation sheds light on Early Bronze Age gold treasures in the old world: New insights from Troy, Poliochni, and related finds","shortTitle":"Portable laser ablation sheds light on Early Bronze Age gold treasures in the old world","creators":[{"firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Numrich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Schwall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nicole","lastName":"Lockhoff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Nikolentzos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Konstantinidi-Syvridi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Cultraro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Horejs","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Türkei"},{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Kaukasus"},{"tag":"Rohstoffquellen"},{"tag":"Gold"},{"tag":"Rohstoffe"},{"tag":"Ägäische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Early Bronze Age gold","type":1},{"tag":"Poliochni","type":1},{"tag":"Portable laser ablation ICP-MS","type":1},{"tag":"Provenance analyses","type":1},{"tag":"Troy","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2022-12-23T13:37:19Z","dateModified":"2022-12-23T13:37:19Z","itemID":27312,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NumrichEtAl2023PortableLaser"},{"key":"DLDMJ8T4","version":10627,"itemType":"book","place":"Princeton, N.J. ; Woodstock","publisher":"Princeton University Press","ISBN":"9780691016023 (hbk.) 069101602X (hbk.)","date":"2008","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3409","title":"Apocalypse : earthquakes, archaeology, and the wrath of God","numPages":"xi, 309 p.","creators":[{"firstName":"Amos","lastName":"Nur","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Burgess","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Erdbeben"},{"tag":"Klima"},{"tag":"Umwelt"},{"tag":"Kollaps"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:42:24Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T10:30:45Z","itemID":4924,"notes":[{"key":"KIXNL6SD","version":2479,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"DLDMJ8T4","note":"<p>2007026170<br/>GBA815488<br/>Amos Nur ; with Dawn Burgess.<br/>ill., maps ; 25 cm.<br/>Includes bibliographical references (p.

Jhs. zwischen den Niederlanden und Südskandinavien seit 1993 fast verdoppelt, so dass rund 2.000 publizierte Grundrisse ein- bis dreischiffiger Häuser katalogisiert werden konnten. Zur differenzierten Betrachtung ihrer Entwicklung wurden architektonische Merkmale wie Struktur und Abfolge der Innenräume, äußere Erscheinung [z.B. Dachform], Wandbauweise und Eingangssituationen untersucht. So lassen sich über 40 Haustypen unterscheiden, deren genaue Datierung die Grundlage für dynamische Modelle der Hausentwicklung bildet. Durch zeitlich differenzierte Kartierungen zeichnen sich Unterschiede zwischen Landschaften erstmals deutlich ab, z.B. im Falle dreier Gebiete mit dreischiffigen Häusern. Insgesamt gibt es fünf architektonische “Traditionsgebiete”. Bei der Siedlungsform setzen sich Gebiete mit Dörfern von Regionen mit Weilern ab wie z. B. Westfalen. An Gehöfttypen lassen sich ebenfalls fünf Varianten unterschieden. Abschließend wird anhand der sogenannten “Herrenhöfe” die Sozialgeschichte untersucht.","title":"Haus, Gehöft und Siedlung im Norden und Westen der Germania magna","creators":[{"firstName":"Hans-Jörg","lastName":"Nüsse","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Römische Kaiserzeit"},{"tag":"Hausbau"},{"tag":"Germanen"},{"tag":"Völkerwanderungszeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:49Z","itemID":8523,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Nusse2014HausGehoft"},{"key":"ZFZZA6P5","version":4151,"itemType":"book","place":"Iaşi","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6070","abstractNote":"Cartea analizeaza artefactele din os si corn descoperite pe siturile de epoca romana si bizantina timpurie (secolele I-VI p.Chr.) din zona Dobrogei de Nord, pe teritoriul provinciei Moesia Inferior si, ulterior, al provinciei Scythia. Este o premiera an arheologia romaneasca din aceasta regiune unde obiectele realizate din materii dure animale au fost, an general, neglijate. Autorii propun o analiza interdisciplinara, prin ambinarea datelor arheologice cu cele arheozoologice. Pe parcursul celor cinci capitole ale lucrarii sunt abordate problemele privind tehnica fabricarii obiectelor din os si corn, atelierele din Imperiul Roman si caracteristicile morfologice ale materiilor dure animale. Artefactele sunt discutate an capitolul patru al cartii, ampartite pe categorii functionale: obiecte de toaleta personala, accesorii vestimentare, obiecte de uz cotidian, piese de echipament militar si miscellanea.
