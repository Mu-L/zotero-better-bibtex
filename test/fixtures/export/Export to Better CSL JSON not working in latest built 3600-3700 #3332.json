Bei dieser Diskussion spielten Siedlungsreste - besonders keramische Funde - kaum eine Rolle. Vielmehr entzogen sich diese der näheren Datierung, da Gräber der Späthallstatt- und Frühlatènezeit Südwestdeutschlands nur selten Gefäßkeramik führen. Es ist das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit, anhand von Siedlungsfunden, Kriterien zu ermitteln, die es erlauben, späthallstattzeitliche und frühlatènezeitliche Formen der Gefäßkeramik zu erkennen und zu unterscheiden. Das Arbeitsgebiet umfasst das Gebiet der Regierungsbezirke Stuttgart und Tübingen des Landes Baden-Württemberg. Fast vier Fünftel der betrachteten Fundstellen konzentrieren sich im nördlichen Teil, vor allem im Neckarraum. Die Fundplätze orientieren sich an den Tallandschaften, fundfrei bleiben das Schwäbisch-Fränkische Bergland sowie der Schönbuch mit seinen nördlichen Ausläufern. Das Verbreitungsbild scheint die landwirtschaftlich und klimatisch begünstigten Regionen nachzuzeichnen. Der nördliche Trauf der Schwäbischen Alb markiert jedoch nicht nur eine geographische, sondern auch eine deutliche Grenze bezüglich des Quellenbestandes. Südlich dominieren Grabhügelfunde, Funde von Höhensiedlungen und aus Höhlen. Umgekehrt wird das Bild im Norden beherrscht von Flachlandsiedlungen und Flachgrabfunden, die insbesondere bei Flurbegehungen und Baumaßnahmen beobachtet wurden. Der Fundbestand erweist sich abhängig vor allem von Faktoren der Forschungsgeschichte, der modernen Landschaftsnutzung und der Aktivität von Sammlern. Anhand der von K. Goldmann entwickelten \"Gütemaßordnung\", deutlicher jedoch anhand einer Seriation von Grubeninhalten nach dem Modell des Schwerpunkts einer Verteilung werden Tendenzen der Entwicklung keramischer Formen greifbar. In Siedlungen der ausgehenden Späthallstattzeit fehlen datierende Metallfunde der Stufe Ha D1, ebenso keramische Elemente wie scharf abgesetzte Trichter- und Kragenränder, Leisten- und Kerbzier in der Halskehle, Ritzdekor in der Tradition 'Alb-Hegauer' Keramik, Bemalung oder feinstreifige Graphitierung. Charakteristisch sind gestreckte bis leicht gewölbte Gefäßkörper und ausbiegende Ränder. Im Gefäßunterteil einziehende Wandungen sind kaum mehr anzutreffen, ebenso spitze und verjüngte Ränder. Bezeichnend für die handgefertigte Tonware der Frühlatènezeit sind demgegenüber ovale Umrisse. Die Gefäßkontur tendiert zum Parabelbogen. Die Gefäßoberteile sind oft s-förmig mit ausschwingendem Rand. Bisweilen wirken sie gedrückt, gekehlt, bis sichelförmig gestaltet. Während der Stufe Ha D3 taucht riefenverzierte und scheibengedrehte Keramik auf - noch in geringer Zahl, jedoch allgemein verbreitet. Kennzeichnend für die frühe Ware ist die sehr sorgfältige Überarbeitung. Auf der Drehscheibe wird ausschließlich Feinkeramik gefertigt, insbesondere Flaschen und Schalen. Ältere Form- und Zierdetails sind Riefenbündel mit flacher Zwischenrippe oder Schmalriefengruppen mit Zwischengraten sowie einfache Randabschlüsse. Breitriefenzier scheint mit der Frühlatènezeit aufzukommen. Wohl während LT B werden betonte, verdickte keulenförmige Randgestaltungen beliebt, dazu Rippenzier und trichterartig ausbiegende Randpartien. Spät erst werden Formen der Gebrauchskeramik, einfach geformte Schüsseln und Töpfe, ins Repertoire der Scheibentöpferei übernommen. Datierende Metallfunde in Siedlungszusammenhang sowie frühlatènezeitliche Grabfunde aus Grabhügeln und Flachgräbern unterstreichen, dass sich während der Späthallstatt- und der Frühlatènezeit mehrfach ein Wandel des Besiedlungsbildes vollzieht. Dieser erfasst die Besiedlung im flachen Land wie auch die in geschützter Höhenlage. Deutliche Verschiebungen zeichnen sich mit dem Ende der Stufe Ha D1 ab sowie während LT B. Letztere markiert wohl den Übergang zur Mittellatènezeit. Siedlungsverlagerungen und Veränderungen der Bestattungsweisen deuten allerdings auch Verschiebungen am Übergang von Stufe LT A zu LT B an. Weder die Siedlungsentwicklung, noch die keramischen Formen geben allerdings einen Formenbestand zu erkennen, der allein für die Stufe Latène A bezeichnend wäre. Man gewinnt vielmehr das Bild einer kontinuierlichen Entwicklung.","title":"Siedlungsfunde der ausgehenden Späthallstatt- und frühen Latènezeit in Württemberg","creators":[{"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Klein","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:00Z","itemID":10923,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Klein2020SiedlungsfundeAusgehenden","publisher":"Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen","type":"Dissertation"},{"key":"2EENN2BC","version":27949,"itemType":"computerProgram","url":"https://zenodo.org/records/15369892","date":"2025-05-09","extra":"Language: eng\nDOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15369892","accessDate":"2025-06-26T07:04:15Z","libraryCatalog":"Zenodo","abstractNote":"AutArch README\n\nSummary\n\n \n\nAutArch is an AI-assisted workflow capable of creating uniform archaeological datasets from heterogeneous published resources. The implementation provided here takes large and unsorted PDF files as input, and uses neural networks to conduct image processing, object detection, and classification.\n\n \n\nRecommended Hardware\n\nWe support Intel CPUs; we do not officially support ARM64 CPUs. This version/guide only uses a CPU for the ML models for easier compatibility. We strongly recommend at least 60 GB of free HDD space (40 GB for AutArch + 20 GB for figures). To reproduce all results we strongly recommend at least 16 GB of RAM.\n\n \n\nRecommended Operating Systems\n\nThis version/guide only covers the use of Windows or Linux while using WSL2. Other operating systems (e.g., Mac OS X) are not covered here (successful tests on Mac OS X have been carried out, though). Without loss of generality, the starting guide below is mostly written from the perspective of Windows (with WSL2).\n\n \n\nStarting Guide (Linux)\n\nAutArch and the reproduction of the figures have been successfully tested on Linux systems running Ubuntu 24.04 and 24.10 – other Linux versions should work as well. Please refer to the official docker website for general installation information:\n\n \n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n\n \n\nStarting Guide (AutArch for Windows using WSL2)\n\nThis section is a prerequisite to the next section on reproducing the underlying paper’s figures and tables. The section is written at times from the perspective of Windows (with WSL2), but the instructions similarly apply to other operating systems.\n\n \n\n1. Installing Docker Desktop\n\nDownload WSL2 Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/wsl/ . Install WSL2 Docker Desktop on your computer and restart it. Open the Docker Desktop app and agree to the terms of service.\n\n \n\nIf Docker Desktop does not start, press CTRL + ALT + DELETE and end any instance of Docker running in the background. If you have not downloaded WSL before, you will get an error message saying that you need to update WSL. Go into the PowerShell in Windows and download/update WSL by entering the following command:\n\n \n\nwsl --update\n\n \n\nReopen Docker Desktop and press finish. You should see the start page with the container.\n\n \n\nFor what follows, make sure that Docker Desktop is running in the background.\n\n \n\n2. Locating the AutArch Docker folder\n\nGo into the Windows PowerShell, change the directory to the unpacked folder you created when downloading and unzipping AutArch. Unpacking may have created an autarch_prebuilt folder within an autarch_prebuilt folder. \n\n \n\nCheck that you are in the right directory – there should be files like these ones:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe readme.\n\n\n\n\nThe main Docker file autarch_prebuilt/compose.yml.\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n \n\nThis folder uses public prebuilt images that are pulled from the docker registry.\n\n \n\n3. Running AutArch\n\nMake sure that Docker Desktop is running in the background (see above).\n\n \n\nMake sure that you are in the autarch_prebuilt folder in the shell (see above).\n\n \n\nIn the PowerShell, type the following command:\n\n \n\n$ docker compose up\n\n \n\nWhen you do this for the first time, this step may take quite a while because public prebuilt images are pulled from the docker registry.\n\n \n\nMake sure to leave the terminal opened in the background. \n\n \n\nIt may take a few minutes for the Docker containers to start up.\n\n \n\nWatch out for output lines like the following to appear:\n\n \n\nweb-1       | * Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000\n\ndb-1        | 2025-04-13 13:26:58.776 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections\n\n \n\n(These lines may not appear next to each other.)\n\n \n\nOnce these lines have appeared, AutArch should have finished booting.\n\n \n\nGo to your internet browser (Chrome, Edge etc.) and enter the following address:\n\n \n\nhttp://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000\n\n \n\nYou should be at the homepage of the AutArch software.\n\n \n\n4. Using AutArch\n\nMake sure AutArch is up and running (see above).\n\n \n\nOnly some basic usage of AutArch is discussed here. See the Workflow section below for more information.\n\n \n\nA basic function of AutArch is the ability to upload and analyse a publication that contains grave drawings. Click 'Upload Publication', choose a PDF file to upload, enter article information, then press 'create publication'. All PDFs used in the database can be found in the PDFs folder. We consider them a good starting point.\n\n \n\nAnalysing the PDF may take a while, depending on the nature of the document. Note: The Docker environment supplied will only rely on the CPU. Certain aspects of the processing of PDFs will be slower than if the environment had a compatible GPU available.\n\n \n\nOnce the analysis of the publication is done, proceed to 'Graves' and filter by the publication you just uploaded. The uploaded publication should be available in the list, which is ordered alphabetically. Select it and click 'filter'.\n\n \n\nIf graves have been successfully detected, these will show in the list below. You can make edits by clicking the 'edit' button. Follow the steps one by one until all graves have been processed or click 'Graves' to return to the list.\n\n \n\nClick 'Publications', select any publication from the list and click 'Stats' for a graphical overview of some of the results (e.g. orientation of the graves, whole-outline analysis).\n\n \n\nAutArch allows many other functionalities, such as comparing publications, mapping results etc. See Workflow below for more information.\n\n \n\n5. Closing AutArch\n\nClose the AutArch tab in your internet browser. \n\n \n\nIn the PowerShell, press Ctrl + C to stop the process.\n\n \n\nYou can also stop the Docker container(s) autarch_prebuilt in Docker Desktop instead.\n\n \n\n6. Reopening AutArch\n\nMake sure Docker Desktop is running (see above).\n\n \n\nMake sure the Docker container(s) autarch_prebuilt are running (see above).\n\n \n\nReproducing figures and tables\n\nMake sure Docker Desktop and AutArch are running (see above).\n\n \n\nWe recommend having one terminal window (such as Powershell) running AutArch while a second terminal window is used to reproduce the figures.\n\n \n\nIn the second terminal, go to the ‘repoduce_figures’ folder in the ‘autarch_prebuilt’ directory. (That is, keep the first terminal window open for running AutArch in Docker).\n\n \n\nMost of the figures and tables can be reproduced automatically using docker-compose and prebuilt images. Figure 5 requires MATLAB and has to be run manually.\n\n \n\nTable 2 and 3 require upload of supplied PDFs and manual review of the object detection results for 795 pages of PDF.\n\n \n\nInstructions for Figure 1-7 and Table 1-3 are provided below.\n\n \n\nMake sure you are in the  ‘repoduce_figures’ folder for what follows.\n\n \n\nFigure 1\n\nThis part does not require AutArch to be running. This is a self contained script which uses the model in reproduce_figures/figure_1/models/rcnn_dfg.model as the object detection model. Take a screenshot of page 13 of Dobeš & Limburský 2013 and save it as reproduce_figures/figure_1/scripts/dobes_2013_page_13.png.\n\n \n\nUse Powershell or such to run this:\n\n$ cd figure_1\n\n$ docker compose up\n\n \n\nThe output will be found in the reproduce_figures/figure_1/output folder.\n\n \n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nIn case you want to rebuild image:\n\n$ docker build . -t kevin1252/autarch-figure1\n\n \n\nFigure 2\n\nThis part does not require AutArch to be running. This is a self contained script. All code is in reproduce_figures/figure_2/map.py.\n\n \n\nUse Powershell or such to run this:\n\n$ cd figure_2\n\n$ docker compose up\n\n \n\nThe output will be found in the reproduce_figures/figure_2/output folder.\n\n \n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nIn case you want to rebuild image:\n\n$ docker build . -t kevin1252/autarch-figure2\n\n \n\nFigure 3\n\nThe reproduction of figure 3 requires AutArch to be running. \n\n \n\nUse Powershell or such to run this:\n\n$ cd figure_3\n\n$ docker compose up\n\n \n\nThe docker image will automatically take a screenshot of this page:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000/graves/4262/update_grave/resize_boxes?short=true\n\n \n\nThe page that is used for the screenshot can be manually opened in the browser to validate its authenticity. It is the edit page of grave OBJ774 from Dobeš & Limburský 2013.\n\n \n\nThe resulting file can be found in the reproduce_figures/figure_3/output folder.\n\n \n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nIn case you want to rebuild image:\n\n$ docker build . -t kevin1252/autarch-figure3\n\n \n\nFigure 4\n\nThe reproduction of figure 4 requires AutArch to be running. \n\n \n\nUse Powershell or such to run this:\n\n$ cd figure_4\n\n$ docker compose up\n\n \n\nThe docker image will automatically take a screenshot of these pages:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000/maps?tag_id=3&commit=Search \n\nhttp://localhost:3000/publications/1/radar \n\nhttp://localhost:3000/publications/6/radar\n\n \n\nhttp://localhost:3000/maps?tag_id=3&commit=Search\n\nThis page contains the map filtered by the “Corded Ware” tag. It shows all skeletons that were shown inside burials that were assigned to the “Corded Ware” tag, have a location and that have a north arrow and a discernible orientation. By zooming in and clicking on a radar chart, all graves relevant to the  specific radar chart are shown.\n\n \n\nhttp://localhost:3000/publications/1/radar\n\nUnder this URL a radar chart can be found that shows all orientations of skeletons inside burials with discernible orientation and of graves that have a north arrow from the publication Dobeš & Limburský 2013.\n\n \n\nhttp://localhost:3000/publications/6/radar\n\nThis is the same type of chart as mentioned above but for the publication Limburský 2012.\n\n \n\nThe resulting files can be found in the reproduce_figures/figure_4/output folder(The figures in the paper were combined in Illustrator).\n\n \n\nFigure 5\n\nWhen compared to the earlier figures, specific steps are required here. The reproduction of Figure 5 is self-contained and does not require AutArch to be running. The data used for the reproduction is supplied in reproduce_figures/figure_5/graves.json.\n\n \n\nThat is, the figure is to be reproduced using MATLAB version R2024b and PAST version 4.17.\n\nThe following steps are required.\n\n \n\nIn MATLAB:\n\n- Set the working directory to the folder figure_5.\n\n- Run format_data script.\n\n- Copy the output of the variable 'RAWpast' into PAST.\n\n \n\nIn PAST:\n\n- Paste the output from the variable 'RAWpast' into an empty PAST worksheet.\n\n- Select all data with ctr+a.\n\n- Click Geometry > Outlines (2D) > Elliptic Fourier > EFA PCA.\n\n- In the window that opens, \n\n- keep Modes set to 20, \n\n- tick 'invariant to rotation+start, and \n\n- click Compute\n\n- In the scores tab, \n\n- copy the output (EFA PCs)\n\n \n\nBack in MATLAB:\n\n- Save the first two PCs from the PAST EFA PCA as separate variables called 'pc1' and pc2'.\n\n- Run plot_scatter script.\n\n\n\nReferences regarding the code involved:\n\nQianqian Fang (2024).

It is recommended to go to the annotation screen and add all false negative objects.\n\n \n\nTo review all the graves, go to the grave screen. Use the filter on the top to select the publications just uploaded. Then click the edit button of the first grave on the list.\n\n \n\nGrave Data\n\nThe ID assigned to the burial by the authors in the source publication is recorded. In case multiple images of the same grave are shown, the software will prevent duplicates in the results using this ID. In this step, the expert also has the option to discard drawings incorrectly classified as a grave.\n\n \n\nSite\n\nGraves can be assigned to specific sites. Sites can be added here.\n\n \n\nTags\n\nGraves can be given arbitrary tags to discern them and allow for filtering in the overview map. Tags can be added here.\n\n \n\nBoxes\n\nCorrecting bounding boxes. The user can manually add, remove or change the bounding box assigned to a specific grave. Potential tasks include selecting a different scale on the page, resizing bounding boxes because they do not fully encapsulate an object or marking north arrows that were initially missed by object detection. During this step, a manual arrow has to be drawn for every skeleton following the spine and pointing towards the skull, which is necessary to determine the orientation of the skeleton in the grave. Several automated steps are then performed. The contours are calculated using the new bounding boxes and the resulting changes in measurements are saved. The orientation of the north arrow and the deposition type of the skeleton are updated using their respective neural network. The analysis of the scale is performed again.\n\n \n\nContours\n\nAll detected outlines in relation to one particular grave are highlighted, allowing the user, if any issue arises, to return to the previous step and fit, for instance, a manual bounding box around the grave or cross-section to indicate the width, length or depth.\n\n \n\nScale\n\nThe next step is to validate the scale by checking the text indicating the real-world length of the scale. Once this step is completed, all measurements are updated with the new scale information. In case no individual scale is provided and the publication uses a fixed scale, e.g. all drawings are 1:20, a different screen is shown. In this screen, the actual height of the page (in cm) has to be entered manually, together with the ratio of the drawing. This way, all measurements can be calculated in the absence of a scale and the results are fully compatible with scaled publications.\n\n \n\nNorth Arrow\n\nThe angle of the north arrow can be adjusted manually based on a preview. In case an arrow is missing in the drawing, this screen will be skipped and size measurements and contours will still be collected without the orientation.\n\n \n\nSkeleton Information\n\nFinally, the pose of all skeletons has to be validated, which (for now) consists of “unknown”, “flexed on the side” or “supine”. As described above, a neural network will set the initial body position, but it can be adjusted manually. Further positions could easily be added in the future. “Unknown” is used in cases where skeletal remains are visible, but no position can be identified.","title":"AutArch: An AI-assisted workflow for object detection and automated recording in archaeological catalogues","shortTitle":"AutArch","creators":[{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Klein","creatorType":"programmer"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Methoden"},{"tag":"ansehen"},{"tag":"Geometric morphometrics"},{"tag":"Shape Analysis"},{"tag":"Datenanalyse"},{"tag":"KI"},{"tag":"Bildanalyse"},{"tag":"Umrissanalyse"},{"tag":"Software"}],"dateAdded":"2025-06-26T07:04:15Z","dateModified":"2025-06-26T09:05:42Z","itemID":33331,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Klein2025AutArchAIassisted","publisher":"Zenodo"},{"key":"JIXGELE4","version":2295,"itemType":"bookSection","volume":"30","place":"Halle/Saale","publisher":"Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Sachsen-Anhalt","pages":"125-133","date":"2018","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6857","title":"Nachweise der Glockenbecherkultur in der vorgeschichtlichen Siedlungslandschaft bei Gatersleben","creators":[{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Kleinecke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Friederich","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Weber","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Mitteldeutschland"},{"tag":"Sachsen-Anhalt"},{"tag":"Keramikdeponierung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:04:06Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:04:06Z","itemID":10297,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Kleinecke2018NachweiseGlockenbecherkultur","publicationTitle":"Archäologie in Gatersleben.

OXALID database, a collection of Excel sheets with Pb isotope data of ores and artefacts, is still the most cited data source in archaeometry. However, OXALID has not been updated for several years and contains almost exclusively data from Europe, particularly from the Mediterranean area. Digitalisation and open science philosophy currently revolutionise the use of machine-generated data by developing digital data infrastructures. A modernised Pb isotope reference database, which is tailored for, but not limited to archaeometric research is hence overdue. Here, we introduce GlobaLID, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and extendable database and a web application with interactive and statistical tools for user-friendly data handling up to publication quality. GlobaLID aims to be collection point for worldwide Pb isotope data. It is designed as research infrastructure for Pb isotope studies in e.g., archaeometry, ore deposit and environmental geochemistry. As a community engagement project, GlobaLID invites scientists around the world to become active contributors to enable GlobaLID’s rapid growth. We released GlobaLID as a pilot study to showcase the infrastructure we build and provide a starting point for community discussion.","title":"From OXALID to GlobaLID – introducing a modern and FAIR lead isotope database with an interactive application","creators":[{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Klein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Rose","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katrin J.","lastName":"Westner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yiu-Kang","lastName":"Hsu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Metallanalyse"},{"tag":"Datenarchivierung"},{"tag":"Bleiisotopie"},{"tag":"database"},{"tag":"Lead isotopes"},{"tag":"Shiny app"}],"dateAdded":"2022-02-25T10:43:15Z","dateModified":"2022-02-25T19:45:23Z","itemID":12775,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KleinEtAl2021OXALIDGlobaLID"},{"key":"5DS2SV98","version":27939,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440325000937","volume":"179","pages":"106244","publicationTitle":"Journal of Archaeological Science","ISSN":"0305-4403","date":"2025-07-01","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2025.106244","accessDate":"2025-06-25T05:28:09Z","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","abstractNote":"Reconciling the ever-increasing volume of new archaeological data with the abundant corpus of legacy data is fundamental to making robust archaeological interpretations. Yet, combining new and existing results is hampered by inconsistent standards in the recording and illustration of archaeological features and artefacts. Attempts at collating data from images in existing publications first involve scouring the substantial body of existing literature, followed by extracting images that require onerous manual preprocessing steps, like re-scaling, re-orienting, and re-formatting. While the sample sizes of such manual analyses are curtailed by these problems, recent developments in AI and big data methods are poised to accelerate and automate large syntheses of existing data. This paper introduces an AI-assisted workflow capable of creating uniform archaeological datasets from heterogeneous published resources. The associated software (AutArch) takes large and unsorted PDF files as input, and uses neural networks to conduct image processing, object detection, and classification. Objects commonly found in archaeological catalogues – like graves, skeletons, ceramics, ornaments, stone tools, and maps – are reliably detected. Accompanying elements of the illustrations, like North arrows and scales, are automatically used for orientation and scaling. Outlines are then extracted with contour detection, allowing whole-outline morphometrics. Detected objects, contours, and other automatically retrieved data can be manually validated and adjusted via AutArch's graphical user interface. While we test this workflow on third millennium BCE Central European graves and Final Neolithic/Early Bronze Age arrowheads from Northwest Europe, this method can be applied to the vast number of artefacts and archaeological features for which shape, size, and orientation holds technological, functional, cultural, and/or temporal significance. This AI-assisted workflow has the potential to speed-up, automate, and standardise data collection throughout the discipline, allowing more objective interpretations and freeing sample sizes from budget and time constraints.","title":"An AI-assisted workflow for object detection and data collection from archaeological catalogues","creators":[{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Klein","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Muller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"Wohde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Gorelik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Heyd","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Lämmel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yoan","lastName":"Diekmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maxime","lastName":"Brami","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Methoden"},{"tag":"ansehen"},{"tag":"_tablet_ZotMoov"},{"tag":"Geometric morphometrics"},{"tag":"Shape Analysis"},{"tag":"Datenanalyse"},{"tag":"KI"},{"tag":"Bildanalyse"},{"tag":"Umrissanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2025-06-25T05:28:09Z","dateModified":"2025-06-25T06:57:52Z","itemID":33318,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KleinEtAl2025AIassistedWorkflow"},{"key":"K3XBLKTI","version":19544,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Materialhefte zur Archäologie in Baden-Württemberg","place":"Darmstadt","publisher":"Konrad Theiss Verlag","ISBN":"978-3-8062-2970-7","date":"2015","seriesNumber":"102","title":"Sedimente des Degersees: Ein Umweltarchiv - Sedimentologie und Palynologie","creators":[{"firstName":"Angelika","lastName":"Kleinmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Merkt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Mainberger","creatorType":"bookAuthor"},{"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Merkt","creatorType":"bookAuthor"},{"firstName":"Angelika","lastName":"Kleinmann","creatorType":"bookAuthor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Seeufersiedlung"},{"tag":"Palynologie"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Landnutzung"},{"tag":"Geoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Sedimentologie"}],"dateAdded":"2023-05-30T12:55:46Z","dateModified":"2023-05-30T15:17:01Z","itemID":31138,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KleinmannEtAl2015SedimenteDegersees","publicationTitle":"Pfahlbausiedlungen am Degersee: Archäologische und naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen"},{"key":"9M8ZBFD3","version":12499,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"1990","pages":"74-79","publicationTitle":"Archäologische Ausgrabungen in Baden-Württemberg","date":"1991","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_604","journalAbbreviation":"Arch.

Based on the analysis of stone, flint, and copper axes of various types from Pietrele in southern Romania, I argue that social distinction, as deduced from the Varna cemetery, also can be identified in contemporary neighboring regions with poorer burial rituals. In these societies, some members distinguished themselves by their access and accumulation of prestigious items, with a special emphasis on axes, adzes, and shaft-hole axes. This socioeconomic constellation was ideal for the adoption of metallurgy, which was considerably developed for the production of prestigious axe heads. These, in turn, stimulated innovation in other crafts and materials. Distribution patterns, source-critical consideration, and new excavation results indicate that the social order visible in the cemetery of Varna was not limited to the western Black Sea coast but was shared by neighboring communities, where the social reality was masked in seemingly egalitarian funeral rites. Through this discussion, I also bring in recent evidence for early metallurgy in southwestern Asia.","title":"New Research on the “Kings of Metal”: Systems of Social Distinction in the Copper Age of Southeastern Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Klimscha","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Rumänien"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Bulgarien"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:25Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:25Z","itemID":10738,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Klimscha2020NewResearch"},{"key":"SNI84SVR","version":4194,"itemType":"book","series":"Baltic-Pontic Studies 1","place":"Poznań","publisher":"Adam Mickiewicz University","date":"1993","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3059","title":"Weapons of the tribes of the Northern Pontic Zone in the 16th - 10th centuries B.C","creators":[{"firstName":"Viktor I.","lastName":"Klochko","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Rumänien"},{"tag":"Russland"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Pontikum"},{"tag":"Krieger"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","itemID":4325,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Klochko1993WeaponsTribes"},{"key":"8FN4KFZ7","version":4193,"itemType":"book","series":"Baltic-Pontic Studies 11","place":"Poznań","publisher":"Adam Mickiewicz Univ","date":"2002","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3052","title":"Fluted maces in the system of long-distance exchange trails of the Bronze Age. 2350-800 BC","creators":[{"firstName":"Viktor I.","lastName":"Klochko","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Osteuropa"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","itemID":4309,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Klochko2002FlutedMaces"},{"key":"HIMQZYEE","version":4193,"itemType":"book","series":"Baltic-Pontic Studies 10","place":"Poznań","publisher":"Adam Mickiewicz Univ","ISBN":"83-86094-09-5 1231-0344","date":"2001","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3053","title":"Weaponry of Societies of the Northern Pontic Culture Circle. 5000-700 BC","numPages":"376 S","creators":[{"firstName":"Viktor I.","lastName":"Klochko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Inna","lastName":"Pidluska","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Rumänien"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Russland"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Pontikum"},{"tag":"Krieger"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","itemID":4311,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KlochkoPidluska2001WeaponrySocieties"},{"key":"LNNAH8NA","version":12499,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"1996","pages":"214-216","publicationTitle":"Archäologische Ausgrabungen in Baden-Württemberg","date":"1997","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_605","journalAbbreviation":"Arch.

In order to understand the origin of the copper and describe the metallurgical process, we use modern analytical methods (metallography analyses, major/trace element and lead isotope analyses) to describe the samples. Within this study, a representative dataset of trace element composition and lead isotope ratios of non-alloyed and non-recycled corpus of copper ingots from the Late Bronze Age was created. We assume that most of the ingots were not altered by alloying, mixing or recycling. Based on lead isotope ratios and major/trace element composition, we suppose that the origin of the copper could be mostly Alpine ores from the Trentino and Mitterberg regions and possibly the Valais region. By this study, it was proved that copper smelted by a matte smelting process was transported in the form of flat or plano-convex ingots from multiple sources to South Bohemia, where it was subsequently refined and alloyed. Obtained analytical results refute the idea of prevailing copper recycling in the Late Bronze Age.","title":"Tracking Alpine copper—analysis of Late Bronze Age copper ingot hoard from South Bohemia","creators":[{"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Kmosek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yulia V.","lastName":"Erban Kochergina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ondřej","lastName":"Chvojka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Fikrle","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Metallanalyse"},{"tag":"Urnenfelderkultur"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Gusskuchen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:54Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:54Z","itemID":11409,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KmosekEtAl2020TrackingAlpine"},{"key":"NPHH4N5L","version":1773,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Beiträge und Mitteilungen 9, 55 ff","date":"1983","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_608","title":"Ein schnurkeramisches Hügelgrab aus der Gemarkung Pritzen","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Knaack","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:34:38Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:34:38Z","itemID":1121,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Knaack1983SchnurkeramischesHugelgrab"},{"key":"WG837P6R","version":1773,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Braunkohle und Archäologie im Bezirk Cottbus, 61-62","date":"1989","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_609","title":"Das Gräberfeld von Pritzen","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Knaack","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:34:38Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:34:38Z","itemID":1122,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Knaack1989GraberfeldPritzen"},{"key":"PMGBRLFI","version":4002,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"22","pages":"35-87","publicationTitle":"Veröff.

The study presented here addresses bioarchaeological characteristics of these burials and their implications for social differentiation and the sphere of influence of the “princely seat”. It includes osteological, aDNA, and multi-isotope analyses of 27 human individuals and faunal remains. One of the outstandingly rich graves (tumulus 1/grave 1) contained the skeleton of a young man (the “prince”) who consumed a superior diet based on C3 plants that also included considerable amounts of animal protein. The oxygen isotope composition of his enamel is characteristic for the study area, while the strontium isotope data reflect connections beyond the near environs of the “princely seat” and a conceivable non-local origin. The individuals in the conical pits had numerous joint lesions, indicating a strenuous lifestyle. They lack evidence for maternal relationships and differ from the “prince” and other Iron Age burials due to substantial millet consumption and rather low shares of animal protein. Their heterogeneous strontium isotope ratios suggest connections to the western Wetterau area, where settlements may have formed the economic hinterland of the Glauberg hillfort.

The majority of the Únětice population was entombed as single inhumations in rectangular grave pits with a normative position of the body. The goal of the study was to test archaeological hypotheses that the deviant burials may represent socially distinct or nonlocal individuals. Materials and Methods The study comprised up to two teeth and one bone each of 74 human individuals from eight sites and faunal comparative samples. The inhumations included regular, deviant burials in so-called settlement or storage pits, and multiple burials. We investigated radiogenic strontium isotope compositions of tooth enamel (87Sr/86Sr) and light stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of bone collagen (δ13C, δ15N) aiming at the disclosure of residential changes and dietary patterns. Results Site-specific strontium isotope data ranges mirror different geological properties including calcareous bedrock, loess, and glacial till. Independent from burial types, they disclose low portions of nonlocal individuals of up to some 20% at the individual sites. The light stable isotope ratios of burials in settlement pits and rectangular graves overlap widely and indicate highly similar dietary habits. Discussion The analytical results let to conclude that inhumations in settlement pits and multiple burials were two of the manifold burial practices of the Early Bronze Age. The selection criteria of the individuals for the different forms of inhumation remained undisclosed.

We show the crucial role of this institution and its impact on the transformation of population compositions over several hundred years. Evidence for an epoch-transgressing maternal relationship between two individuals demonstrates long-debated population continuity from the central European Neolithic to the Bronze Age. We demonstrate that a simple notion of “migration” cannot explain the complex human mobility of third millennium BCE societies in Eurasia. On the contrary, it appears that part of what archaeologists understand as migration is the result of large-scale institutionalized and possibly sex- and age-related individual mobility.Human mobility has been vigorously debated as a key factor for the spread of bronze technology and profound changes in burial practices as well as material culture in central Europe at the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. However, the relevance of individual residential changes and their importance among specific age and sex groups are still poorly understood. Here, we present ancient DNA analysis, stable isotope data of oxygen, and radiogenic isotope ratios of strontium for 84 radiocarbon-dated skeletons from seven archaeological sites of the Late Neolithic Bell Beaker Complex and the Early Bronze Age from the Lech River valley in southern Bavaria, Germany. Complete mitochondrial genomes documented a diversification of maternal lineages over time. The isotope ratios disclosed the majority of the females to be nonlocal, while this is the case for only a few males and subadults. Most nonlocal females arrived in the study area as adults, but we do not detect their offspring among the sampled individuals. The striking patterns of patrilocality and female exogamy prevailed over at least 800 y between about 2500 and 1700 BC. The persisting residential rules and even a direct kinship relation across the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age add to the archaeological evidence of continuing traditions from the Bell Beaker Complex to the Early Bronze Age. The results also attest to female mobility as a driving force for regional and supraregional communication and exchange at the dawn of the European metal ages.","title":"Female exogamy and gene pool

While the archaeological evidence points to a largely pastoral lifestyle, knowledge regarding the general composition of human diets and their variation across landscapes and during the different phases of the Bronze Age is still restricted. Human and animal skeletal remains from the burial mounds that dominate the archaeological landscape and their stable isotope compositions are major sources of dietary information. Here, we present stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data of bone collagen of 105 human and 50 animal individuals from the 5th millennium BC to the Sarmatian period, with a strong focus on the Bronze Age and its cultural units including Maykop, Yamnaya, Novotitorovskaya, North Caucasian, Catacomb, post-Catacomb and late Bronze Age groups. The samples comprise all inhumations with sufficient bone preservation from five burial mound sites and a flat grave cemetery as well as subsamples from three further sites. They represent the Caucasus Mountains in the south, the piedmont zone and Kuban steppe with humid steppe and forest vegetation to its north, and more arid regions in the Caspian steppe. The stable isotope compositions of the bone collagen of humans and animals varied across the study area and reflect regional diversity in environmental conditions and diets. The data agree with meat, milk, and/or dairy products from domesticated herbivores, especially from sheep and goats having contributed substantially to human diets, as it is common for a largely pastoral economy. This observation is also in correspondence with the faunal remains observed in the graves and offerings of animals in the mound shells. In addition, foodstuffs with elevated carbon and nitrogen isotope values, such as meat of unweaned animals, fish, or plants, also contributed to human diets, especially among communities living in the more arid landscapes. The regional distinction of the animal and human data with few outliers points to mobility radii that were largely concentrated within the environmental zones in which the respective sites are located. In general, dietary variation among the cultural entities as well as regarding age, sex and archaeologically indicated social status is only weakly reflected. There is, however, some indication for a dietary shift during the Early Bronze Age Maykop period.","title":"Diet and subsistence in Bronze Age pastoral communities from the southern Russian steppes and the North Caucasus","creators":[{"firstName":"Corina","lastName":"Knipper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Reinhold","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Gresky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nataliya","lastName":"Berezina","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Gerling","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sandra L.","lastName":"Pichler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexandra P.","lastName":"Buzhilova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anatoly R.","lastName":"Kantorovich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vladimir E.","lastName":"Maslov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vladimira G.","lastName":"Petrenko","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Kaukasus"},{"tag":"Eurasien"},{"tag":"Maikop Kultur"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Yamnaja Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:44Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T11:09:30Z","itemID":11326,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KnipperEtAl2020DietSubsistence"},{"key":"38HLA589","version":3685,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"15","issue":"3","pages":"e0229398","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","date":"2020","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7108","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0229398","abstractNote":"The El Argar society of the Bronze Age in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula (2200–1550 cal BCE) was among the first complex societies in Europe. Its economy was based on cereal cultivation and metallurgy, it was organized hierarchically, and successively expanded its territory. Most of the monumentally fortified settlements lay on steeply sloped mountains, separated by fertile plains, and allowed optimal control of the area. Here, we explore El Argar human diets, animal husbandry strategies, and food webs using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of charred cereal grains as well as human and animal bone collagen. The sample comprised 75 human individuals from the sites of La Bastida (n = 52) and Gatas (n = 23), 32 domesticated and wild animals as well as 76 barley and 29 wheat grains from two chronological phases of a total time span of ca. 650 years. The grains indicate extensive cereal cultivation under rain-fed conditions with little to moderate application of manure. Especially at La Bastida, crops and their by-products contributed significantly to the forage of the domesticated animals, which attests to a strong interrelation of cultivation and animal husbandry. Trophic level spacing and Bayesian modelling confirm that human diets were largely based on barley with some contribution of meat or dairy products. A cross-sectional analysis of bone collagen suggests that children were breastfed until about 1.5–2 years old, and infants from Gatas may have suffered from more metabolic stress than those at La Bastida. Adults of both sexes consumed similar diets that reflect social and chronological variation to some extent. Despite significantly higher δ13C and δ15N values at La Bastida than at Gatas, the isotopic data of the staple crops and domestic animals from both sites indicate that such differences do not necessarily correspond to different average human diets, but to agricultural strategies. These results urge for a reassessment of previous isotope studies in which only human remains have been taken into account. The study highlights that disentangling the complex influences on human isotope compositions requires a firm set of comparative data.","title":"Reconstructing Bronze Age diets and farming strategies at the early Bronze Age sites of La Bastida and Gatas (southeast Iberia) using stable isotope analysis","creators":[{"firstName":"Corina","lastName":"Knipper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Rihuete-Herrada","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Voltas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Held","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Lull","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Micó","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Risch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kurt W.","lastName":"Alt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"El-Argar-Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:27Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:27Z","itemID":10757,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KnipperEtAl2020ReconstructingBronze"},{"key":"HM5EWMD4","version":23542,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25316-9_4","series":"Natural Science in Archaeology","place":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","pages":"45-64","ISBN":"978-3-319-25316-9","date":"2018","extra":"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-25316-9_4","accessDate":"2024-02-22T16:14:33Z","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this contribution, we apply different methods of spatial and geomorphometric analysis in order to present a general approach of data exploration in areas where detailed local information is absent. Our data are based on locations of megalithic graves from Funnel Beaker societies (3700–2800 BCE) in the area of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Using these locations, we apply methods of point pattern analysis in order to reconstruct the spatial processes that created the sample: We use density-based measures to show the influence of first-order effects on the dataset. While first-order effects are related to the underlying areal characteristics of the point locations and hence are determinant of their intensity, second-order effects are the result of interactions between points. We conduct distance-related approaches, e.g. focusing on nearest-neighbour characteristics, in order to investigate the interaction between the points. The point pattern analyses are complemented by integrating geomorphometric measures that are indirectly indicative for some general environmental conditions, even in prehistoric times.

Its goal is to reconstruct funerary practices by using taphonomic evidence, including both evidence recorded during excavation (particularly the context and state of articulation of human remains) and evidence observable in subsequent laboratory analysis (such as element representation and traces of burning, animal modification, cut-marks, and fragmentation). This article – intended as a systematic introduction to the field – gives an overview of funerary taphonomy. It first discusses the goals and theoretical questions, and then reviews the wide range of methods available to archaeologists using human remains to investigate funerary behaviour. It finishes with a review of how taphonomists have approached particular issues, such as single burials, commingled multiple depositions, cannibalism, and the cultural reuse of human skeletal parts.","title":"Funerary taphonomy: An overview of goals and methods","creators":[{"firstName":"Christopher J.","lastName":"Knüsel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Robb","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Taphonomie"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:58:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:58:00Z","itemID":9439,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KnuselRobb2016FuneraryTaphonomy"},{"key":"GXKBHGED","version":4228,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Bayer.

On mesure par là le biais dans la connaissance actuelle. Une typologie des ensembles funéraires reconnus est ensuite proposée avec quatre groupes : les tombes isolées, les petites nécropoles monophasées de deux ou trois dépôts de crémation, les nécropoles d'une dizaine de tombes avec des durées d'occupation parfois plus longues et enfin les grandes nécropoles multiphasées. La dernière partie concerne la continuité et discontinuité des occupations, avec une présentation des nécropoles à partir de leur phase de fondation. Les bilans chronologiques montrent quelques différences régionales tant dans les périodes de fondations que dans la durée des occupations. Enfin, par manque de documentation, les relations entre habitat et nécropoles sont encore difficiles à cerner.","title":"Continuité et discontinuité de l’espace funéraire dans le temps : quelques exemples en Alsace, en Lorraine et en Champagne humide","creators":[{"firstName":"M.-P.","lastName":"Koenig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Plouin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Vanmoerkerke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.","lastName":"Véber","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Bérenger","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Bourgeois","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Talon","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Wirth","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Elsass"},{"tag":"Lothringen"},{"tag":"Chamgagne"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:23Z","dateModified":"2021-11-23T08:37:55Z","itemID":10692,"notes":[],"citationKey":"KoenigEtAl2012ContinuiteDiscontinuite","publicationTitle":"Gräberlandschaften der Bronzezeit / Paysages funéraires de l’âge du Bronze, Actes du colloque international d’Herne, 15-18 oct. 2008"},{"key":"CSRU7WWE","version":26900,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://books.openedition.org/artehis/4767","rights":"https://www.openedition.org/12554","series":"Suppléments à la Revue archéologique de l’Est","place":"Dijon","publisher":"ARTEHIS Éditions","pages":"115-127","ISBN":"978-2-915544-76-3","date":"2015","extra":"Code: L’Homme et son environnement : des lacs, des montagnes et des rivières : Bulles d’archéologie offertes à André Marguet\nDOI: 10.4000/books.artehis.4767","accessDate":"2025-02-07T12:25:35Z","seriesNumber":"40","libraryCatalog":"OpenEdition Books","language":"de","abstractNote":"Der vorliegende Beitrag befasst sich mit Funden und Befunden aus den spätbronzezeitlichen Seeufersiedlungen von Hagnau-Burg und Unteruhldingen-Stollenwiesen am Bodensee.

Social archaeology often studies artefacts and their social significance, whereas landscape archaeology and palaeoecology focus on the economic potential of land- scapes and vegetation cover. With the help of the concept of landscape technologies and the example of Neolithic axes and adzes, the paper stresses that these artefacts were two of the most important innovations in human history, through which the ability of landscape modification was symbolized in ritual depositions, burial rite and supraregional interactions. Therefore the knowledge of the social significance and environmental impact of this technology is crucial for many disciplines.","title":"Axe as landscape technology.

This article uses examples of ceramics and chipped stone tools to illustrate local interactions within regional Eneolithic Corded Ware culture in Moravia, demonstrating that what may appear as a homogeneous archaeological culture spread by mass migration can be understood as a more complex series of overlapping, local cultural changes.","title":"Migrations or local interactions?
