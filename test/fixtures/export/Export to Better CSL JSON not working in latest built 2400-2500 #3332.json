In particular, studies of differing female and male demographic histories on the basis of ancient genomes can provide information about complexities of social structures and cultural interactions in prehistoric populations. We use a mechanistic admixture model to compare the sex-specifically–inherited X chromosome with the autosomes in 20 early Neolithic and 16 late Neolithic/Bronze Age human remains. Contrary to previous hypotheses suggested by the patrilocality of many agricultural populations, we find no evidence of sex-biased admixture during the migration that spread farming across Europe during the early Neolithic. For later migrations from the Pontic Steppe during the late Neolithic/Bronze Age, however, we estimate a dramatic male bias, with approximately five to 14 migrating males for every migrating female. We find evidence of ongoing, primarily male, migration from the steppe to central Europe over a period of multiple generations, with a level of sex bias that excludes a pulse migration during a single generation. The contrasting patterns of sex-specific migration during these two migrations suggest a view of differing cultural histories in which the Neolithic transition was driven by mass migration of both males and females in roughly equal numbers, perhaps whole families, whereas the later Bronze Age migration and cultural shift were instead driven by male migration, potentially connected to new technology and conquest.","title":"Ancient X chromosomes reveal contrasting sex bias in Neolithic and Bronze Age Eurasian migrations","creators":[{"firstName":"Amy","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Torsten","lastName":"Günther","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Noah A.","lastName":"Rosenberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mattias","lastName":"Jakobsson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Migration"},{"tag":"Spätkupferzeit"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2022-06-08T09:44:26Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T10:04:08Z","itemID":16640,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GoldbergEtAl2017AncientChromosomes"},{"key":"BVPFSSAW","version":18098,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1704442114","volume":"114","issue":"20","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","date":"2017-05-16","journalAbbreviation":"Proc.

The aim of this gathering was to provide a forum for rock art researchers from different parts of northern Europe to discuss traditional as well as current interpretative trends within rock art research. \nChanging Pictures aims to return to traditional interpretative notions regarding the meaning and significance of rock art to investigate if and why any information had been left behind to recover and rethink. During the last decades, there has been an immense global interest among archaeologists and anthropologists in studying rock art. Research in northern Europe, as elsewhere, has intensely explored a manifold of methodological and theoretical perspectives. Most of these studies however, have been published in languages that seldom reach beyond the native speakers of Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, Russian or Finnish. Therefore an important motivation for this volume is to try to apprise some of the current movements within this field of research and present it for an international audience.\nThese papers explore the relevance of older ideas, such as notions about prehistoric religion, ritual performance, sympathetic magic, animism and totemism, the mindscapes of landscapes etc., as well as the present \"state of the art\" in order to develop a broader understanding of the phenomenon we call rock art. This aspiration can be seen as a common thread linking the different chapters in this book. Saying that, some, if not all, of the articles presented in this volume challenge the notion \"rock art\" itself, arguing that sometimes the rock, the \"canvas\" and rather intangible but equally important sensual encounters, such as sound, echoes, touch and temporal phenomenological changes and the perception of decorated rock art panels, should be regarded, at least, as important as the \"art\" itself. \nBy reassessing traditional approaches to Scandinavian rock art and creatively reworking these ideas, whilst also addressing significant new concepts such as the agency of rock and the performativity of rock art, this anthology of papers offers not only a snapshot of current debates, but also reflects pivotal changes in the study of rock art.","title":"Changing Pictures: Rock Art Traditions and Visions in the Northernmost Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Goldhahn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Fuglestvedt","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Meirion Jones","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"},{"tag":"Felskunst"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:34:11Z","itemID":7428,"notes":[{"key":"VXU5J8HW","version":2609,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"L2J3Q7FI","note":"<p>Table of Contents</p><p>1.

Ceramics from the site are covered in dense white concretions, and it has been noted during compositional analyses that these vessels exhibit elevated concentrations of several potentially mobile elements in comparison to vessels from regional tell sites. Here, we use a multimethod (optical mineralogy, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, PXRF, SEM-EDS, and LA-ICP-MS) mineralogical and chemical approach to characterize the composition of surface encrustations on ceramics samples from Békés 103. We also chemically map interior paste composition using LA-ICP-MS to identify potential leaching of mobile elements into or out of vessel bodies. We demonstrate that the surface encrustations are primarily composed of calcite but also contain a variety of other mineral and organic constituents indicative of deposition of soil carbonates, phosphates, nitrates, and other inorganic and organic components. We further document the leaching of several mobile elements into ceramic pastes as well as formation of secondary calcite along void, pore, and temper boundaries. The presence of cremated bone and possibly bone ash in close vicinity to many of the studied vessels may also have contributed to the observed patterns of diagenesis. It is likely that similar post-burial processes might affect ceramics from other sites located in low-lying, seasonally inundated contexts.","title":"Down to the Crust: Chemical and Mineralogical Analysis of Ceramic Surface Encrustations on Bronze Age Ceramics from Békés 103, Eastern Hungary","shortTitle":"Down to the Crust","creators":[{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Golitko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"McGrath","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Attila","lastName":"Kreiter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ian V.","lastName":"Lightcap","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul R.","lastName":"Duffy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Györgyi M.","lastName":"Parditka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Julia I.","lastName":"Giblin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Keramikanalyse"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"}],"dateAdded":"2021-05-31T09:48:35Z","dateModified":"2021-05-31T09:48:35Z","itemID":456,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GolitkoEtAl2021CrustChemical"},{"key":"P35L2IDH","version":2318,"itemType":"book","series":"Arch. im Thurgau","place":"Frauenfeld","publisher":"Department für Erziehung und Kultur des Kantons Thurgau","date":"1999","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7095","seriesNumber":"7","title":"Ürschhausen-Horn.

J.C.). Les études typologiques de la céramique rubanée avaient abouti à une perception plutôt homogène des assemblages et l’analyse des décors avait permis la mise au point de séquences chronologiques particulièrement précises. Pourtant, plusieurs questions restaient en suspens, en particulier sur le contexte de production des vases, ainsi que sur l’origine des producteurs de la céramique dite du Limbourg, présente en petite quantité sur certains sites de la zone d’étude, qui se distingue de la céramique rubanée par une forme et un dégraissant spécifiques.\n\nDans chacun des villages étudiés, il semble que la production céramique ait eu lieu à l’échelle de la maisonnée, bien qu’il ne soit pas possible d’exclure des formes de coopération entre maisons voire entre villages. La mise en perspective chronologique et spatiale des résultats technologiques à l’échelle intrasite permet de supposer que les dynamiques d’implantation des producteurs à l’échelle locale différaient d’un site à l’autre. À l’échelle macro-régionale, une distribution préférentielle des différentes traditions techniques dans certaines régions de peuplement a pu être observée, parfois tout au long de la séquence. Cette répartition pourrait suggérer des contacts privilégiés entre certaines zones de peuplement rubané, qu’il s’agisse de la circulation de savoir-faire, de récipients ou d’individus.\n\nL’étude technologique des vases Limbourg révèle des manières de faire variées. Il est possible d’opposer un Limbourg « standard », dont les caractères formels et techniques sont homogènes et dont la distribution est transrégionale à un Limbourg « imité ». Les vases Limbourg « imités » présentent des caractères formels typiques du Limbourg « standards », mais ils ont été façonnés selon des traditions majoritairement employées pour la réalisation des vases rubanés. Ce résultat original permet d’envisager que les vases Limbourg avaient un statut tout à fait particulier pour les communautés rubanées et conduit à formuler plusieurs hypothèses sur l’identité de leurs fabricants.","title":"Traditions techniques et production céramique au Néolithique ancien.

In particular, heat-induced bone warping and thumbnail fractures have been linked to the burning of fleshed and green bones - where the soft tissues have been removed from the bones soon after death - in contrast to dry bones. Those have been suggested as indicators of the state of the individual before being burned thus allowing inferences about the funerary behaviour of archaeological populations. A large sample of 61 skeletons submitted to cremation has been examined for the presence of both of these heat-induced features. Although uncommon, bone warping and thumbnail fractures were present in some of the skeletons demonstrating that its presence is not restricted to the burning of non-dried bones as generally believed. Rather than being an indicator of the presence of bones with soft tissues, bone warping seems to be more of an indicator of the preservation of collagen-apatite links which can be maintained on dry bones with low collagen deterioration. In addition, our results also do not confirm thumbnail fractures as an exclusive sign of the burning of bones with soft tissues. As a result, these heat-induced changes should be used with caution when trying to infer about the pre-burning state of an individual.","title":"Implications of Heat-induced Changes in Bone on the Interpretation of Funerary Behaviour and Practice","creators":[{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Gonçalves","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T.

In Western and Central Europe, these changes occurred rapidly and synchronously after the arrival of early farmers of Anatolian origin [1–3], who largely replaced the local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers [1, 4–6]. Further east, in the Baltic region, the transition was gradual, with little or no genetic input from incoming farmers [7]. Here we use ancient DNA to investigate the relationship between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Lower Danube basin, a geographically intermediate area that is characterized by a rapid Neolithic transition but also by the presence of archaeological evidence that points to cultural exchange, and thus possible admixture, between hunter-gatherers and farmers. We recovered four human paleogenomes (1.1× to 4.1× coverage) from Romania spanning a time transect between 8.8 thousand years ago (kya) and 5.4 kya and supplemented them with two Mesolithic genomes (1.7× and 5.3×) from Spain to provide further context on the genetic background of Mesolithic Europe. Our results show major Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) ancestry in a Romanian Eneolithic sample with a minor, but sizeable, contribution from Anatolian farmers, suggesting multiple admixture events between hunter-gatherers and farmers. Dietary stable-isotope analysis of this sample suggests a mixed terrestrial/aquatic diet. Our results provide support for complex interactions among hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Danube basin, demonstrating that in some regions, demic and cultural diffusion were not mutually exclusive, but merely the ends of a continuum for the process of Neolithization.","title":"Paleogenomic Evidence for Multi-generational Mixing between Neolithic Farmers and Mesolithic Hunter-Gatherers in the Lower Danube Basin","creators":[{"firstName":"Gloria","lastName":"González-Fortes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eppie R.","lastName":"Jones","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emma","lastName":"Lightfoot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clive","lastName":"Bonsall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Catalin","lastName":"Lazar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aurora","lastName":"Grandal-d’Anglade","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"María Dolores","lastName":"Garralda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Labib","lastName":"Drak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Veronika","lastName":"Siska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Simalcsik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adina","lastName":"Boroneanţ","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan Ramón","lastName":"Vidal Romaní","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Vaqueiro Rodríguez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Arias","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Pinhasi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Manica","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hofreiter","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithisierung"},{"tag":"Rumänien"},{"tag":"Mesolithikum"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Jäger-Sammler"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2017-05-30T08:34:37Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T07:52:29Z","itemID":16,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Gonzalez-FortesEtAl2017PaleogenomicEvidence"},{"key":"NH73DFQU","version":4661,"itemType":"book","url":"https://www.sidestone.com/books/artisans-versus-nobility","ISBN":"978-90-8890-396-0","date":"2017/03/20","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7191","extra":"Artisans versus nobility?

A comparison of the spindle whorls from these two settlements with a contemporaneous East-Central European dataset suggests that multiple culture-historical groups with distinct technological signatures inhabited Neolithic Central Europe. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of conical spindle whorls within the pre-Alpine settlements suggests the immigration of both people and technology from the east, thereby illuminating the wider themes of mobility and innovation in prehistoric Europe.","title":"The interaction of distant technologies: bridging Central Europe using a techno-typological comparison of spindle whorls","shortTitle":"The interaction of distant technologies","creators":[{"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Grabundžija","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Schlichtherle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Urs","lastName":"Leuzinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfram","lastName":"Schier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Karg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Handwerk"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Horgener Kultur"},{"tag":"Badener Kultur"},{"tag":"Textilproduktion"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-04T11:34:41Z","dateModified":"2021-06-04T11:34:41Z","itemID":441,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GrabundzijaEtAl2021InteractionDistant"},{"key":"IWV7BNRK","version":13206,"itemType":"book","series":"Universitätsforsch.

Rather than trying to elucidate what people may have thought, we suggest focusing on ritual as action; these actions have a huge communicative and transformative potential and thus it is their effect on society that interests us here. This social efficacy can be scrutinized archaeologically in the longue durée. We apply this understanding to a new approach to the study of hoards and deposits. These, too, are understood as the results of ritual action, i.e. sequenced and communicative practice that involves handling and manipulating cultural knowledge, reproducing and maybe altering it, thus affecting social identities and relations. We therefore suggest focusing on the depositional practice rather than the motivations behind deposition. Moreover we suggest proceeding from the understanding of depositions as ritual actions to analysing what effect they had on space and how they simultaneously were directed by culturally perceived spatial structures.","title":"An Archaeological Outline of Ritual Dynamics and Social Space","creators":[{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Gramsch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Meier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Serena","lastName":"Sabatini","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Sophie","lastName":"Bergerbrant","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Religion"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Raumkonzepte"},{"tag":"#Raumkonzepte"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:11Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:11Z","itemID":8311,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GramschMeier2013ArchaeologicalOutline","publicationTitle":"Counterpoint: Essays in Archaeology and Heritage Studies in Honour of Professor Kristian Kristiansen"},{"key":"UZ68ZTW5","version":20055,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/15/5/687","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","volume":"15","issue":"5","pages":"687","publicationTitle":"Diversity","ISSN":"1424-2818","date":"2023/5","DOI":"10.3390/d15050687","accessDate":"2023-07-25T08:05:23Z","libraryCatalog":"www.mdpi.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"Fluctuations in the size of taurine cattle (Bos taurus) have been regularly demonstrated using archaeozoological data from across time and space in Europe, and have been linked to cultural, social and economic changes, but little is known about whether phenotypic change is accompanied by changes in genetic diversity. Here, we performed PCR-typed analysis of the partial mtDNA d-loop fragments of 99 cattle from the Neolithic to Early Medieval times from a number of different sites across Switzerland, combining newly presented data with previously published data (n = 20). We found that most cattle included (84) were members of the common European macro-haplogroup T3. However, cattle belonging to the haplogroups T1, T2, Q and P were identified as early as the Neolithic period, before 2690 cal. BCE. The highest diversity was found in the Neolithic period, during the 1st century CE and during the 7th–8th centuries CE. Bottleneck phases with low genetic diversity were detected during the Late Iron Age and from the fifth to the seventh century CE. Based on the FST values, Horgen, Corded Ware and cattle populations from the seventh to the ninth century CE were plotted away from the clusters of all other populations. The periods with larger-sized cattle correspond with those of high mtDNA d-loop diversity. Phenotype and genotype both appear to respond to the same socio-economic and cultural processes.","title":"The mtDNA D-Loop Legacy of Cattle: Fluctuations in Diversity from the Neolithic to Early Medieval Times in Switzerland","shortTitle":"The mtDNA D-Loop Legacy of Cattle","creators":[{"firstName":"José","lastName":"Granado","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Wright","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Blatter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jürg","lastName":"Lange","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Meral","lastName":"Turgay","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Bañuelos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Deschler-Erb","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Stopp","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Marti-Grädel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marguerita","lastName":"Schäfer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Idoia","lastName":"Grau-Sologestoa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Ammann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Debora","lastName":"Schmid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex R.","lastName":"Furger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Reto","lastName":"Marti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jörg","lastName":"Schibler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Schlumbaum","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Spätneolithikum"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Horgener Kultur"},{"tag":"Latènezeit"},{"tag":"Mittelalter"},{"tag":"Frühmittelalter"},{"tag":"Rind"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2023-07-25T08:05:24Z","dateModified":"2023-07-25T08:05:24Z","itemID":31243,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GranadoEtAl2023MtDNADLoop"},{"key":"M9SBE4ES","version":8587,"itemType":"book","place":"London","publisher":"Routledge","ISBN":"0415236398 (pbk) 041523638X","date":"2002","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3421","title":"The archaeology coursebook : an introduction to study skills, topics and methods","numPages":"xxviii, 321 p.","creators":[{"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Grant","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Gorin","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Fleming","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Einführung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:42:42Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:34:52Z","itemID":4955,"notes":[{"key":"NK9R3YUA","version":2481,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"M9SBE4ES","note":"<p>2001019758<br/>Jim Grant, Sam Gorin, Neil Fleming.<br/>ill. ; 25 cm.<br/>Includes bibliographical references (p. ) and index</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:42:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:42:42Z"}],"citationKey":"GrantEtAl2002ArchaeologyCoursebook"},{"key":"68MY4KWY","version":4292,"itemType":"book","series":"Weimarer Monogr. zur Ur- u.

Many applications are sensitive to the radiocarbon (14C) content of atmospheric CO2, which has varied since 1890 as a result of nuclear weapons testing, fossil fuel emissions, and CO2 cycling between atmospheric, oceanic, and ter- restrial carbon reservoirs. Over this century, the ratio 14C/C in at- mospheric CO2 (Δ14CO2) will be determined by the amount of fossil fuel combustion, which decreases Δ14CO2 because fossil fuels have lost all 14C from radioactive decay. Simulations of Δ14CO2 using the emission scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, the Representative Concentration Pathways, indicate that ambitious emission reduc- tions could sustain Δ14CO2 near the preindustrial level of 0‰ through 2100, whereas “business-as-usual” emissions will reduce Δ14CO2 to −250‰, equivalent to the depletion expected from over 2,000 y of radioactive decay. Given current emissions trends, fossil fuel emission-driven artificial “aging” of the atmosphere is likely to occur much faster and with a larger magnitude than previously expected. This finding has strong and as yet unrecognized im- plications for many applications of radiocarbon in various fields, and it implies that radiocarbon dating may no longer provide de- finitive ages for samples up to 2,000 y old.","title":"Impact of fossil fuel emissions on atmospheric radiocarbon and various applications of radiocarbon over this century","creators":[{"firstName":"Heather D.","lastName":"Graven","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:03:50Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:03:50Z","itemID":10254,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Graven2015ImpactFossil"},{"key":"NZYWX7FP","version":4662,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"1-38","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society","ISSN":"0079-497X","date":"2020","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7330","DOI":"10.1017/ppr.2020.6","abstractNote":"Radiocarbon dating and Bayesian chronological modelling have provided precise new dating for the henge monument of Mount Pleasant in Dorset, excavated in 1970–1.

This suggests that the henge was probably built in the 26th century cal bc, shortly followed by the timber palisade and Site IV ditch. These major construction events took place in the late Neolithic over a relatively short timespan, probably lasting 35–125 years.

However, scrutiny of the data reveals that, if human sacrifice did take place in Iron Age Europe, it appears to have been both rare and special.

He proposed that the earliest domestic stock animals in the Near East (sheep, goat and cattle) were initially domesticated during the Neolithic for their primary products (meat, hide and bone), but that their more intensive exploitation for secondary animal products (milk, wool and traction) appeared in the Near East much later (during the Chalcolithic) and subsequently spread to surrounding regions (Europe and Asia). While the zooarchaeological evidence largely supports the model, questions have been raised about its veracity since there is evidence for pre-Chalcolithic exploitation of secondary products (e.g. ceramic lipid analyses). This paper summarizes past efforts to test the model, presents the results of recent research on the subject (e.g. artefactual, zooarchaeological and lipid analysis) and suggests directions for future research. Some of the discrepancies that have arisen between the archaeological, ceramic lipid and zooarchaeological data will be discussed.","title":"The Secondary Products Revolution: the past, the present and the future","creators":[{"firstName":"Haskel J.","lastName":"Greenfield","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Theorie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:44:46Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:44:46Z","itemID":5453,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Greenfield2010SecondaryProducts"},{"key":"BY4CRTYY","version":8173,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5582","abstractNote":"Animal Secondary Products investigates domestic animal exploitation and the animal economy from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze and Iron Ages across Eurasia (Europe, Near East, Siberia and China). Incorporating current zooarchaeological theory and cutting-edge methodological developments, it critically assesses Andrew Sherratt’s concept of a Secondary Products Revolution that proposed that a package of new subsistence practices and technologies swept across much of Eurasia at the end of the Neolithic, which triggered large-scale changes in economies and settlement across the landscape. \n\nThis model argues that these changes were associated with a genuine shift from an emphasis upon domestic animals for their primary (meat hide, bone) products to a more diversified exploitation pattern which included their secondary (milk, wool, traction) products. Sherratt’s model attempted to conceptualise the changes between the Neolithic and Bronze Age that dramatically transformed the nature of animal exploitation strategies, cultivation practices, land management strategies, nature of settlement, and political and economic organization in Europe and the Near East that set the stage for the evolution of historic land use and animal exploitation patterns. Though setting the parameters for debate within the discipline for over 30 years, science has moved on and many kinds of new data, methods and techniques have been proposed since then that allow greater insights into these issues.\n\nIn this volume, thirteen papers present a holistic discussion of Sherratt’s concept and investigate the theoretical development in our understanding of the origins of milking, wool production, transhumance, as well as examining the need for a contextualised zooarchaeological analysis and harvest profiles from various international sites in order to reconstruct the nature of Secondary Products exploitation. It also extends the secondary products concept across the Old World into Siberia and China and back in time to the Palaeolithic with the domestication of dogs. Through reviewing artefacts and textual evidence, the book bridges an important divide by cross-referencing statistical and scientific data with more traditional archaeological techniques and demonstrates the necessity of using many techniques to analyse data before interpreting patterns as exploitation practices. Offering fresh insight into the development of civilisation from the Neolithic and Bronze and Iron Ages in the Near East, Europe, and China, this book will be important for archaeozoologists and prehistorians.","title":"Animal Secondary Products: Domestic Animal Exploitation in Prehistoric Europe, the Near East and the Far East","creators":[{"firstName":"Haskel J.","lastName":"Greenfield","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Secondary products revolution"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:54Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:34:59Z","itemID":7843,"notes":[{"key":"C5ZGXKNJ","version":2626,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"BY4CRTYY","note":"<p>Table of contents</p><p>I.\tIntroduction <br/>a.\tby Haskel J.

Although human burials are still absent from the site, a number of fragmented human bones have been recovered from fill deposits of buildings and from adjacent areas. We focus on three partially preserved human skulls, all of which carry artificial modifications of a type so far unknown from contemporaneous sites and the ethnographic record. As such, modified skull fragments from Göbekli Tepe could indicate a new, previously undocumented variation of skull cult in the Early Neolithic of Anatolia and the Levant.\nCarved and drilled skull fragments from a circa 11,000-year-old ritual site point to an undocumented variation of skull cult.\nCarved and drilled skull fragments from a circa 11,000-year-old ritual site point to an undocumented variation of skull cult.","title":"Modified human crania from Göbekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult","creators":[{"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Gresky","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juliane","lastName":"Haelm","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Clare","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithisierung"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Schädelkult"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Vorderer Orient"},{"tag":"Türkei"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"}],"dateAdded":"2017-07-03T07:46:57Z","dateModified":"2021-06-24T10:17:10Z","itemID":178,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GreskyEtAl2017ModifiedHuman"},{"key":"HQMZFITG","version":24623,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01888-7","rights":"2024 The Author(s)","pages":"1-14","publicationTitle":"Nature Human Behaviour","ISSN":"2397-3374","date":"2024-06-03","extra":"Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-024-01888-7","accessDate":"2024-06-11T10:10:24Z","libraryCatalog":"www.nature.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"The early Iron Age (800 to 450 BCE) in France, Germany and Switzerland, known as the ‘West-Hallstattkreis’, stands out as featuring the earliest evidence for supra-regional organization north of the Alps. Often referred to as ‘early Celtic’, suggesting tentative connections to later cultural phenomena, its societal and population structure remain enigmatic. Here we present genomic and isotope data from 31 individuals from this context in southern Germany, dating between 616 and 200 BCE. We identify multiple biologically related groups spanning three elite burials as far as 100 km apart, supported by trans-regional individual mobility inferred from isotope data. These include a close biological relationship between two of the richest burial mounds of the Hallstatt culture. Bayesian modelling points to an avuncular relationship between the two individuals, which may suggest a practice of matrilineal dynastic succession in early Celtic elites. We show that their ancestry is shared on a broad geographic scale from Iberia throughout Central-Eastern Europe, undergoing a decline after the late Iron Age (450 BCE to ~50 CE).","title":"Evidence for dynastic succession among early Celtic elites in Central Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Joscha","lastName":"Gretzinger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felicitas","lastName":"Schmitt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Mötsch","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Selina","lastName":"Carlhoff","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thiseas Christos","lastName":"Lamnidis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Huang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Ringbauer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Corina","lastName":"Knipper","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Francken","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Franziska","lastName":"Mandt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Leif","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cäcilia","lastName":"Freund","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cosimo","lastName":"Posth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Rathmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katerina","lastName":"Harvati","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Günther","lastName":"Wieland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lena","lastName":"Granehäll","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Maixner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Zink","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfram","lastName":"Schier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Krausse","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Krause","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Schiffels","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"},{"tag":"Hallstattzeit"},{"tag":"Fürstengrab"},{"tag":"Kelten"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2024-06-11T10:10:24Z","dateModified":"2024-06-11T10:10:57Z","itemID":32289,"notes":[],"citationKey":"GretzingerEtAl2024EvidenceDynastic"},{"key":"USYCRC9K","version":3637,"itemType":"book","series":"Garland folklore bibliographies","place":"New York ; London","publisher":"Garland","ISBN":"0-8153-0831-0","date":"1992","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3312","seriesNumber":"v 17","title":"Holy wells and sacred water sources in Britain and Ireland : an annotated bibliography","numPages":"xiii, 179 p.","creators":[{"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Gribben","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Irland"},{"tag":"Brunnen"},{"tag":"Folklore"},{"tag":"Quellen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:41:36Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T11:46:53Z","itemID":4756,"notes":[{"key":"3UKB6PIU","version":2468,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"USYCRC9K","note":"<p>92-23000<br/>GB 92-50933<br/>Arthur Gribben<br/>23 cm<br/>Includes bilbiographical references (p. ) and index.</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:41:36Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:41:36Z"}],"citationKey":"Gribben1992HolyWells"},{"key":"A26WCXRX","version":26660,"itemType":"book","url":"https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/produkt/die-speichergruben-der-spaeturnenfelderzeitlichen-wallanlage-von-stillfried-an-der-march/99200924","series":"Mitteilungen der Prähistorischen Kommission","place":"Wien","publisher":"Verlag der ÖAW","ISBN":"978-3-7001-8734-9","date":"2022","accessDate":"2023-07-13T06:50:07Z","seriesNumber":"92","language":"de_DE","abstractNote":"Bestellen sie jetzt Die Speichergruben der späturnenfelderzeitlichen Wallanlage von Stillfried an der March in unserem Verlagswebshop.","title":"Die Speichergruben der späturnenfelderzeitlichen Wallanlage von Stillfried an der March.
