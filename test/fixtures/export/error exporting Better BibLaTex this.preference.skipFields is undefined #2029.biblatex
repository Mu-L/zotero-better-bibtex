  abstract = {{$<$}p class="first" id="d388814e66"{$>$}To defend the thesis of “permanent violence” in Yemen that leads to state failure and in the context of the structural crisis of capital (where Keynesianism has reached its structural limits), this article will look at the Yemeni war through a Marxist lens. It aims to analyze the deep sociological roots of the Yemeni war through the laws of capital as presented by Marx and to show why the Yemeni war is a goal in itself for Imperialism. Three main laws of capital are considered: (1) the general law of capital accumulation developed in Volume I of \emph{Das Kapital}, (2) the law of the “transformation” of value into price as presented in Volume III of \emph{Das Kapital}, and (3) the law relating to the contradiction between production and consumption (leading to a crisis of overproduction and a crisis of underconsumption) that was developed by Marx in the \emph{Grundrisse}, in \emph{Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844}, and by contemporary Marxist author, Istvan Mészáros \emph{.} All of these laws are all tied to the Marxist “law of value” which refers to the idea that socially necessary labor time acts as the ultimate regulating force in exchange and production under Imperialism. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

For Marx, market prices of a certain commodity all tend towards the average "price of production" of this commodity. The price of production is equal to the cost-price (capital spent on constant capital and variable capital, i.e., living labor16) + the average rate of profit of capital (that equalizes across different sectors and industries). This average rate of profit is a part of the total surplus value which reflects the rate of profit of firms with an average organic composition of capital.17 The capitals that manage to lower their price of production by increasing the organic composition of their capital vis-à-vis the average one will be able to incorporate "absolute" or "relative" surplus value (beyond the average one) in their goods to appropriate a higher share of profit in the free market at the expense of the rest of the capitals (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43P472HQ?page=5}{Kadri 2021:5})

The real cost of an iPhone is maybe \$1,000 or so, but its value is much, much more. Through paying for the iPhone, we are possibly paying for the wars and waste that were necessary to obtain all the raw product and cheap labor for iPhone production (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43P472HQ?page=8}{Kadri 2021:8})

even though the different Yemeni wars seem to have cost the American imperialist camp hundreds of billions of dollars since 2002, these billions are incomparable to the immense surplus value realized by monopoly-financial capital thanks to the war itself and the mass pauperization in the strategic Yemeni nation. Monopoly-financial capital derives huge imperial rents from a weakened Yemeni state, the expansion of the dollar supply, and the increased military presence of the American, Saudi, Emirati, and Israeli armies in the Arab world (including the expansion of Israelis on Palestinian land (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43P472HQ?page=4}{Kadri 2021:4})
