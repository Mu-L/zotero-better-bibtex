Here, the authors combine osteological and radiocarbon analyses of inhumations from Vráble. Rather than a straightforward sign of inter-community conflict and war, this development reflects a culmination of internal conflict and a diversification in the ritual treatment of human bodies. The emerging variability in LBK methods of manipulating and depositing dead bodies can be interpreted as an experimental approach in how to negotiate social conflicts and community boundaries.","title":"New burial rites at the end of the Linearbandkeramik in south-west Slovakia","creators":[{"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Müller-Scheeßel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zuzana","lastName":"Hukeľová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Meadows","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Cheben","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Furholt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühneolithikum"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Bandkeramik"},{"tag":"Slowakei"},{"tag":"Sonderbestattung"},{"tag":"Bestattungssitten"}],"dateAdded":"2021-09-21T09:20:18Z","dateModified":"2021-10-14T06:08:36Z","itemID":11760,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Muller-ScheesselEtAl2021NewBurial"},{"key":"WWGGTRYK","version":4324,"itemType":"book","place":"Stuttgart","date":"1999","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2105","title":"Opferkulte der Germanen und Slawen.

In the south, individual power structures allowed for the integration of new status items, and early copper daggers are imitated in flint, whereas in the north these objects were ‘lost in history’ since the prevailing collective ideology did not embrace individual power structures.

While ‘demography’ is just as important for social developments as ‘economy’, newly arising theoretical and methodological discourses on social demography and social archaeology have sharpened tools and interpretations for demographic considerations. With this background in mind, some results of archaeological research on demography are presented. For both the Near East and Europe, population calculations (6500–1500 BCE) put forth information on absolute values of population sizes and shifts in demographic development. Te potential of the investigation is found in the interlinking of technological, social and demographic changes. For the ﬁrst time, a combination of Near Eastern and European values is presented. On the one hand, they underline the structural diﬀerence between both supra-regions and, on the other hand, they verify demographic shifts and changes dependent in both areas on changes, e.g., in subsistence technologies or social formation processes. Around 6000 BCE, about 1 million humans lived in Europe, whereas around 2000 BCE already nearly 8 million inhabitants lived on the continent. In consequence, a paradigm has changed:  Archaeology of the twenty-ﬁrst century is able to integrate demographic proxies into analyses from local to global scales.","title":"Eight Million Neolithic Europeans: Social Demography and Social Archaeology on the Scope of Change – from the Near East to Scandinavia","creators":[{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kristian","lastName":"Kristiansen","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Ladislav","lastName":"Šmejda","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Turek","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Demografie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:59:09Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:59:09Z","itemID":9591,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Muller2015EightMillion","publicationTitle":"Paradigm Found: Archaeological Theory – Present, Past and Future.

The discontinuation of the development of existing designs after a certain number of generations displays the lacking stable chain of ideological patterns over the course of generations: a recreaion of the society became necessary. If our interpretation is valid, BB societies in Central Europe must still be considered to have been organized in dramatically unstable conditions: Probably the limitation of ideological transmissions over time limited the development of stable political institutions.

In Scandinavia and northern central Europe a four-phase chronology is outlined: Early Neolithic (4100–3400 BC); Middle Neolithic (3400–2800 BC); Younger Neolithic (2800–2300 BC); and Late Neolithic (2300–1700 BC). While regional variations are visible in the Early Neolithic, during the Middle Neolithic elaborated pottery designs became enormously varied until this tendency decreased during the late Middle Neolithic. New pottery traditions emerged in the Younger Neolithic and Late Neolithic, in conjunction with new supra-regional cultural trends. Throughout, pottery design and fabric could be used as a proxy for societal developments. Neolithic pottery in Britain and Ireland was produced from shortly after 4000 BC. There are regional variations but overall a four phase chronology for the pottery is also suggested: First Neolithic, approximately 4000–3800 BC; Early Neolithic, approximately 3800–3500 BC; Middle Neolithic, approximately 3500–2900 BC; and Late Neolithic, approximately 2900–2400 BC. Within this framework evidence for the processes of pottery production and use are studied to define a number of different traditions and practices. The external form of vessels seems to be strongly codified in the early part of the period, although there was a range of different inclusion recipes used. In the Middle and Later Neolithic there seem to be much simpler fabrics but a greater range of vessel shapes.

development of functional portable optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) readers over the last decade has provided practitioners with the capability to acquire luminescence signals from geological materials relatively rapidly, which allows for expedient preliminary chronostratigraphic insight when working with complex depositional systems of late Quaternary age. Typically, when using the portable OSL reader, infrared (IR) or blue post-IR OSL signals are acquired from bulk unprocessed materials, in contrast to regular luminescence dating, which is usually based on measurements on pure quartz or feldspar mineral separates, or on select silt-sized polymineralic portions. To demonstrate the utility of portable OSL measurements, this paper outlines the basic features of portable OSL readers and their constraints. Subsequently, case studies in which the instrument has been used to elucidate cryptostratigraphic variations in sedimentary sequences for geomorphological applications are reviewed. The studies can generally be grouped into three main categories. The first includes studies where the variation of portable OSL reader luminescence signal intensities with depth are plotted to generate profiles that contextualize sediment stratigraphy. In the second group, portable OSL reader luminescence signal intensities are used to interpret sediment processes that shed light on depositional histories. In the last category, luminescence signals from the portable OSL reader are calibrated to approximate numerical burial ages of depositional units. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible future directions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","title":"The potential of portable luminescence readers in geomorphological investigations: a review","shortTitle":"The potential of portable luminescence readers in geomorphological investigations","creators":[{"firstName":"Kennedy","lastName":"Munyikwa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tim C.","lastName":"Kinnaird","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David C.W.","lastName":"Sanderson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"OSL-Datierung"},{"tag":"Datierung"},{"tag":"Lumineszensdatierung"}],"dateAdded":"2024-09-17T08:53:04Z","dateModified":"2024-09-17T08:54:10Z","itemID":32622,"notes":[],"citationKey":"MunyikwaEtAl2021PotentialPortable"},{"key":"GBMGNGAA","version":22231,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"9","pages":"614-615","publicationTitle":"Fundberichte aus Baden-Württemberg","date":"1984","DOI":"10.11588/fbbw.1984.0.30846","title":"Remseck am Neckar Hochberg (Kreis Ludwigsburg)","creators":[{"firstName":"F.","lastName":"Munz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"F.","lastName":"Maurer","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"dateAdded":"2023-12-13T10:51:47Z","dateModified":"2023-12-13T10:53:20Z","itemID":31592,"notes":[],"citationKey":"MunzMaurer1984RemseckAm"},{"key":"LXTSR8I8","version":25456,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Tagungen des Landesmuseums für Vorgeschichte Halle","place":"Halle/Saale","pages":"259-276","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6977","seriesNumber":"11","title":"Native silver resources in Iberia","creators":[{"firstName":"Mercedes","lastName":"Murillo-Barroso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Montero Ruiz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Bartelheim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Risch","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Sozialstruktur"},{"tag":"Sozialarchäologie"},{"tag":"Silber"},{"tag":"El-Argar-Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:05:50Z","dateModified":"2024-10-10T11:32:07Z","itemID":10522,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Murillo-BarrosoEtAl2014NativeSilver","publicationTitle":"Metalle der Macht – Frühes Gold und Silber. 6.

All have a similar objective in mind, however, namely to understand how children were treated in death by different cultures in the past; to gain insights concerning the roles of children of different ages in their respective societies and to find evidence of the nature of past adult–child relationships and interactions across the life course. The contextualisation and integration of the data collected, both in the field and in the laboratory, enables more nuanced understandings to be gained in relation to the experiences of the young in the past. A broad range of issues are addressed within the volume, including the inclusion/exclusion of children in particular burial environments and the impact of age in relation to the place of children in society. Child burials clearly embody identity and ‘the domestic child’, ‘the vulnerable child’, ‘the high status child’, ‘the cherished child’, ‘the potential child’, ‘the ritual child’ and the ‘political child’, and combinations thereof, are evident throughout the narratives. Investigation of the burial practices afforded to children is pivotal to enlightenment in relation to key facets of past life, including the emotional responses shown towards children during life and in death, as well as an understanding of their place within the social strata and ritual activities of their societies. An important new collection of papers by leading researchers in funerary archaeology, examining the particular treatment of juvenile burials in the past. In particular focuses on the expression of varying status and identity of children in the funerary archaeological record as a key to understanding the place of children in different societies.","title":"Children, Death and Burial: Archaeological Discourses","shortTitle":"Children, Death and Burial","creators":[{"firstName":"Eileen","lastName":"Murphy","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Mélie","lastName":"Le Roy","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Kinderbestattung"},{"tag":"Kind"}],"dateAdded":"2024-10-29T11:34:13Z","dateModified":"2024-11-14T08:36:29Z","itemID":32853,"notes":[{"key":"98JHVJA2","version":26070,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"FK8PRNKC","note":"<div class=\"box-collateral box-description\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; color: #2f2f2f; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">\n<h2 style=\"margin: 10px 0px 15px; padding: 0px 0px 1px; line-height: 1.35; color: #406eac; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5dcc3;\">Table of Contents</h2>\n<div class=\"std\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px;\">\n<div style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: small;\">1.

Ancient Fortifications in the Eastern Mediterranean and is intended as a guide to research on ancient fortifications and a source of inspiration for new research.\nAncient city walls and other fortification structures have long been underestimated. Since the early years of the 21st century, research on ancient fortifications has experienced an international boom, particularly amongst young researchers. They approached the study of fortifications with fresh ideas and new aims, and felt the need to discuss the problems and potentials of these monuments and to develop harmonised research methods and objectives. The outcome is the present bilingual (English and German) book, which offers a condensed view of the network’s extended conversations. The goal is not so much to offer an overview on the development of ancient fortifications, but rather to present versatile and diverse approaches to their research and interpretation and to serve as a kick-off for a new understanding of this category of ancient buildings.\nThe book is divided into two parts: the first part includes 12 chapters on methods of interpretation, documentation, and field project organisation; the systematic description and presentation of fortifications; the‘building experience’; masonry forms and techniques; defensive, symbolic, and urbanistic functions and aspects; on fortifications in written sources, the visual arts, and as a historical source; and on regional and rural fortifications, and regionally confined phenomena. Part two is a catalogue that offers exemplary presentations of fortifications studied by network members; it is arranged in four sections: regions, sites, architectural elements and architectural details.\nThe book is Volume 1 in the new series Fokus Fortifikation Studies. Volume 2 in the series, Focus on Fortification: New Research on Fortifications in the Ancient Mediterranean and the Near East (Oxbow Books), the proceedings of an international conference held in Athens in December 2012, will also appear in 2015.","title":"Ancient Fortifications.

Dieser Ansicht zufolge können Polygamie und Monogamie als konkurrierende Strategien angesehen werden, die sich unter bestimmten Umständen ausbreiten. Der folgende Beitrag will dies auf der Grundlage archäologischer Daten überprüfen. Dazu werden aus zwölf Gräberfeldern der Kupfer- und Bronzezeit in Mitteleuropa detaillierte Informationen zum Geschlechterverhältnis und zu Unterschieden im Reichtum der Grabausstattung ausgewertet. Diese Ergebnisse werden dann mit den Vermögensunterschieden und der Subsistenzgrundlage der ausgewählten Populationen verglichen. Es scheint, dass diesen beiden Faktoren für die Erklärung der Vielfalt menschlicher Heiratssysteme eine Schlüsselrolle zukommt.\n\nDie potentiellen Ergebnisse dieser Studie steuern neue Argumente für die Diskussion um Heiratsformen in frühen europäischen Gesellschaften bei. Andererseits kann ein Vergleich gewisser Elemente archäologischer Quellen mit Konzepten aus der Humanökologie zu einem besseren Verständnis der Funktionsweise prähistorischer Gesellschaften beitragen.","title":"Räumliche Interaktionsmodelle","creators":[{"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Nakoinz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"GIS"},{"tag":"Raumanalyse"},{"tag":"Interaktion"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:52:20Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:52:20Z","itemID":8016,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Nakoinz2013RaumlicheInteraktionsmodelle"},{"key":"DRZBPI3P","version":10552,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Topoi – Berliner Studien der Alten Welt","place":"Berlin","pages":"83-104","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6474","seriesNumber":"16","title":"Zentralorte in parallelen Raumstrukturen","creators":[{"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Nakoinz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Svend","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Meyer","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Hsdlg_FbzMbz"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"},{"tag":"Raumkonzepte"},{"tag":"Raumanalyse"},{"tag":"#Raumkonzepte"},{"tag":"Geschlechtsdifferenzierung"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:59:29Z","dateModified":"2021-11-23T09:58:04Z","itemID":9617,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Nakoinz2013ZentralorteParallelen","publicationTitle":"Parallele Raumkonzepte"},{"key":"G6Y9D5PF","version":23632,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://www.edition-topoi.org/article/1350-modelle-der-polyzentralitat","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","series":"Berlin Studies of the Ancient World","place":"Berlin","publisher":"Topoi","pages":"125-144","date":"2017","extra":"DOI: 10.17171/3-47-4","accessDate":"2024-02-23T13:31:18Z","seriesNumber":"47","libraryCatalog":"refubium.fu-berlin.de","abstractNote":"Zentralität im Sinne Christallers geht von einem Zentrum aus, das ein Ergänzungsgebiet beziehungsweise Territorium mit zentralen Funktionen versorgt.

Polyzentralität bedeutet das Vorliegen mehrerer sich ergänzender Zentren in einem Territorium. Hierzu werden graphentheoretische Methoden, Dichtecluster-Analysen, die Methode der idealen Isolinie und die Betrachtung von Verkehrsnetzwerken herangezogen.

Dieser Ansatz spielte in der Geographie über Jahrzehnte hinweg eine große Rolle und gilt heute als obsolet. In der Archäologie ist der Ansatz allerdings noch immer von großer Bedeutung. Die vorliegende Arbeit beabsichtigt eine Reflexion und Modifikation der zentralörtlichen Theorie. Zunächst wird die Ausgangslage diagnostiziert und die Probleme der zentralörtlichen Theorie werden herausgearbeitet. Anschließend werden diese Probleme gezielt behoben. Die wirtschaftsgeographische Zentralitätsdeﬁnition wird verallgemeinert und auf den Begriff der Interaktion ausgerichtet. Anschließen wird dieser Ansatz mit Netzwerkkonzepten integriert, in denen eine andere Art von Zentralität definiert ist. Durch die Verallgemeinerung wird eine Harmonisierung der Zentralitätsbegriffe Christallers und der Netzwerkforschung erreicht und die beiden vormals unvereinbaren Theorien werden zu komplementären Modellen, die Zentralität auf unterschiedliche Weise umsetzen. Danach werden quantitative und semiquantitative Methoden der Zentralitätsforschung vorgestellt und auf Fallstudien aus Topoi angewendet.","title":"Zentralität.

In the recent years, conflict archaeology has developed into a growing sub-discipline. This article tries to go beyond the traditional concepts of conflict archaeology that mainly addressing violence. We advocate widening the view on conflicts by including different levels of conflict escalation as well as of conflict de-escalation. Archaeological indicators for all of these facets of conflicts are discussed. Here, we concentrate on fortifications which are sensitive indicators of historical, social, economic and cultural processes and hence are able to indicate different facets of conflicts and not only violence. In this context, we also consider territoriality as relevant, because it is a kind of regulation, preventing conflicts from further escalation. The article presents a simple scheme of conflict archaeology which extends the traditional approach and provides deeper insights in human behaviour and its rational.","title":"Competition and

Each lecture comprises 20 pages, in which the methods are introduced, examples shown and the code is given. All examples are computed with open source software, mainly R, and with archaeological data available from the book's website.\nThe book does not describe elaborated high-end models but rather very basic modelling concepts that serve as components in more complex models. The book enables the reader to construct such models by themselves and be sensitive for certain problems. In addition it gives hints for the interpretation of the results.\nStudents are usually quick to apply fancy methods yet fail in the proper interpretation due to a lack of understanding of the underlying principles. This problem is addressed by the proposed book through three concepts:\n1. Command line software forces the students to first learn some details before they are able to produce results on their own.\n2. The book is focused on principles and methods. When the students understand a few basic principles, they have far better access to a wide range of related methods.\n3. Examples of poor analysis highlight common pitfalls.\nThe volume attempts to be an applied, minimalistic and efficient textbook and is based upon several successful courses.\nhttp://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319295367","title":"Modelling Human Behaviour in Landscapes - Basic Concepts and Modelling Elements","creators":[{"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Nakoinz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Knitter","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"GIS"},{"tag":"Statistik"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:03:09Z","dateModified":"2024-02-22T16:24:30Z","itemID":31894,"notes":[],"citationKey":"NakoinzKnitter2016ModellingHuman"},{"key":"AEJVC87U","version":23872,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Schriften des Museums für Archäologie Schloss Gottorf, Ergänzungsreihe","place":"Bonn","publisher":"Habelt","pages":"285-303","date":"2022","seriesNumber":"15","abstractNote":"Fortifications are perceived to be linked to conflict and warfare or ritualistic usage in archaeology. But how can archaeologists understand the functionality of fortifications better? In this paper, we maintain that fortifications play specific roles in escalation as well as in de-escalation processes and that these roles are tightly connected to their locations. We apply the concept of ‘ROOTS of Conflicts: Competition and Conciliation’ (Subcluster 6 of the Cluster of Excellence ROOTS), which considers de-escalation and conciliation to be as important as escalation and competition. We specify different orders of location that are based on the placement of fortified sites in their natural and social environments, constituting absolute and relative space. Functionality of the fortifications can be deduced from their integration into the stated environments. Finally, the presented case studies demonstrate the diverse uses of the introduced concepts and shed a new light on possible interpretations of connected fortifications. The case studies span the concepts of counter-castles (Santok/Zantoch [PL]), pairs of fortifications (along the Schlei fjord [D]), supra-regional ‘twins’ (brochs [GB]), poly-centrality (Lossow and Lebus [D]), network centrality (princely seats of the Early Iron Age [D]), and directed monumentality (Es Rossells [E]).","title":"The Location of Connected

Reymann (2020, 5) proceeds with a kind of translation of this definition into an archaeological context: ‘The fortification is therefore just a place, which has been artificially improved in reference to its defences [...]’.

Narasimhan et al. identify a complex pattern of human migrations and admixture events in South and Central Asia by performing genetic analysis of more than 500 people who lived over the past 8000 years (see the Perspective by Schaefer and Shapiro). They establish key phases in the population prehistory of Eurasia, including the spread of farming peoples from the Near East, with movements both westward and eastward. The people known as the Yamnaya in the Bronze Age also moved both westward and eastward from a focal area located north of the Black Sea. The overall patterns of genetic clines reflect similar and parallel patterns in South Asia and Europe.Science, this issue p. eaat7487; see also p. 981RATIONALETo elucidate the extent to which the major cultural transformations of farming, pastoralism, and shifts in the distribution of languages in Eurasia were accompanied by movement of people, we report genome-wide ancient DNA data from 523 individuals spanning the last 8000 years, mostly from Central Asia and northernmost South Asia.RESULTSThe movement of people following the advent of farming resulted in genetic gradients across Eurasia that can be modeled as mixtures of seven deeply divergent populations. A key gradient formed in southwestern Asia beginning in the Neolithic and continuing into the Bronze Age, with more Anatolian farmer–related ancestry in the west and more Iranian farmer–related ancestry in the east. This cline extended to the desert oases of Central Asia and was the primary source of ancestry in peoples of the Bronze Age Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC). This supports the idea that the archaeologically documented dispersal of domesticates was accompanied by the spread of people from multiple centers of domestication.The main population of the BMAC carried no ancestry from Steppe pastoralists and did not contribute substantially to later South Asians. However, Steppe pastoralist ancestry appeared in outlier individuals at BMAC sites by the turn of the second millennium BCE around the same time as it appeared on the southern Steppe. Using data from ancient individuals from the Swat Valley of northernmost South Asia, we show that Steppe ancestry then integrated further south in the first half of the second millennium BCE, contributing up to 30% of the ancestry of modern groups in South Asia. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the unique features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.The primary ancestral population of modern South Asians is a mixture of people related to early Holocene populations of Iran and South Asia that we detect in outlier individuals from two sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), making it plausible that it was characteristic of the IVC. After the IVC’s decline, this population mixed with northwestern groups with Steppe ancestry to form the “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and also mixed with southeastern groups to form the “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI), whose direct descendants today live in tribal groups in southern India. Mixtures of these two post-IVC groups—the ANI and ASI—drive the main gradient of genetic variation in South Asia today.CONCLUSIONEarlier work recorded massive population movement from the Eurasian Steppe into Europe early in the third millennium BCE, likely spreading Indo-European languages. We reveal a parallel series of events leading to the spread of Steppe ancestry to South Asia, thereby documenting movements of people that were likely conduits for the spread of Indo-European languages.The Bronze Age spread of Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry into two subcontinents—Europe and South Asia.Pie charts reflect the proportion of Yamnaya ancestry, and dates reflect the earliest available ancient DNA with Yamnaya ancestry in each region. Ancient DNA has not yet been found for the ANI and ASI, so for these the range is inferred statistically.By sequencing 523 ancient humans, we show that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Asians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and Southeast Asia. After the Indus Valley Civilization’s decline, its people mixed with individuals in the southeast to form one of the two main ancestral populations of South Asia, whose direct descendants live in southern India. Simultaneously, they mixed with descendants of Steppe pastoralists who, starting around 4000 years ago, spread via Central Asia to form the other main ancestral population. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the distinctive features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.","title":"The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia","creators":[{"firstName":"Vagheesh
