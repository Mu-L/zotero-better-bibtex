Numerous methods of analysis and interpretations were proposed, but they do not still adapt to the specificities of the Neolithic ceramic productions characterized essentially by their low intensity and their great variability. Does this mean that the organization of the productions is unique and constant? The case studies analyzed in this article, and which are not exhaustive, let on the contrary imagine the big variety of the forms that the potter activity could take during the Prehistory. On top of the domestic productions, certainly majority, we can recognize at least standardized and specialized productions and particular productions with a strong symbolic value.\nDemonstrate that the Neolithic ceramic productions are realized in a domestic frame is not still the most frequent exercise. These productions, realized by one or several potters of the house for the inhabitants of the same house, should be characterized essentially by local materials, relatively diversified shapes for the everyday life, technical or stylistic features peculiar to every house, production limiting itself to the renewal of the broken dishes, thus in low number and then not very standardized because not very habitual. The variability of the assemblages is often the only argument to define the domestic character of the Neolithic productions. It can nevertheless correspond to various forms of productions. The spatial analysis of the categories of pottery is the most relevant, still it is necessary to have sites and ceramic assemblages relatively well preserved. Among the criteria used to discriminate between the productions, the stylistic aspects and the composition of paste are generally favoured in the studies on the Neolithic. It is also possible to track more exactly the potters and their specificities by criteria linked to the apprenticeship stages. In a domestic production, all the stages, from the clumsy vases of the novice up to perfect vessels of the well-skilled potter, should be discovered within the same house. Analyses led from the design execution of Neolithic painted vessels illustrate this method.\nIt is more difficult to apply the notion of specialization to the Neolithic pottery, on one hand because the definition is still discussed and on the other hand because the cases without ambiguity are really rare. The standardization of the productions, the specific skills of the potters, the repetitiveness of products and their particular distribution are the major criteria to define a specialized production. For the Neolithic, only vases used as mould for salt loaf correspond to the whole definition.\nHowever, some authors also include in the category « specialized » productions of low intensity and which are not standardized. These productions are essentially characterized by their context of use, ritual or funerary.","title":"Productions domestiques, productions spécialisées… et le reste ?

The present study aimed to verify whether portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF) can be used to differentiate bone fragments at the species level (Bos taurus, Sus domesticus, Equus caballus, and Homo sapiens) and at the individual level of human individuals. We also aimed to verify whether species and individuals can be differentiated using pXRF even if the bones were burned. A total of 119 adult human bones from archaeological sites in Central Moravia and Silesia and 17 adult non-human bones from archaeological sites in Central Moravia (Czech Republic) were examined. All bones are dated to various periods (from the Bronze Age to Modern Times). When differentiating the unburnt and burnt bones at the species level, the overall accuracy of classification was 84.6% and 93.9%, respectively. When differentiating unburnt human bones at the individual level, the correct classification ranged from 88.1% to 72.7%. The differentiation of the burnt bones of humans at the individual level achieved an average success rate of more than 60%. The results confirmed that pXRF can be used for species and individual differentiation of unburnt bones and is almost equally applicable to burnt bones.","title":"A Study of Species and Individual Differentiation of Burnt and Unburnt Bones Using X-Ray Fluorescence","creators":[{"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Sál","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Pankowská","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ladislav","lastName":"Šmejda","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence)"}],"dateAdded":"2024-01-18T08:14:59Z","dateModified":"2024-01-18T08:17:51Z","itemID":31763,"notes":[],"citationKey":"SalEtAl2023StudySpecies"},{"key":"D5HJ4HNY","version":20909,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://revistas.uam.es/archaeofauna/article/view/archaeofauna2020_29_005","rights":"Derechos de autor 2020","volume":"29","pages":"77-106","publicationTitle":"Archaeofauna","ISSN":"1132-6891","date":"2020-07-29","DOI":"10.15366/archaeofauna2020.29.005","accessDate":"2023-09-28T14:32:48Z","libraryCatalog":"revistas.uam.es","language":"en","abstractNote":"Since the 1990s, the Schwaz-Brixlegg mining district in the Lower Inn Valley, North Tyrol, Austria, features excavations on mostly Late Bronze (LBA) to Early Iron (EIA) Age sites, focusing on the reconstruction of metallurgic activities and of all aspects related to it. This paper reviews the Schwaz-Brixlegg archaeozoological materials and compares them with those from contemporaneous mining (copper and salt) sites on the Eastern Alps, to assess diet and subsistence strategies of the early alpine, geo-resource-centered, communities.\nThe faunal remains from Schwaz-Brixlegg document a change in diet for the Lower Inn Valley area from the LBA to the EIA exemplified by a shift from a pig-based economy to another one based on cattle and occasionally small ruminants. These species were most often brought whole to the sites and only occasionally as meat cuts (in particular, ribs). Age and sex profiles indicate that miners consumed high-quality meat. As is also documented on prehistoric mining sites from the Eastern Alps, butchery marks evidence a standardized slaughtering process car- ried out by professional butchers. At Weißer Schrofen, pig was the main meat provider during the LBA, whereas cattle and sheep/goat were more important as dairy products and wool/skin providers. This pattern changed in the EIA, when sheep became the dominating meat supplier at the site of Bauernzeche.\nThis shift may reflect an adaptation to climate changes, which determined the amount of fodder available for stocks, and/or to the impact of cultural and economic developments taking place during the Final Bronze Age. Variations on the faunal assemblages might also reflect agents such as topography and altitude. All in all, a logistic balance between miners (consumers) and peasants (producers) is revealed although more information is required (e.g. archaeobotany), to shed more light on the major changes recorded in the EIA.\nBased on gnawing marks from Weißer Schrofen, some of the dogs there must have been large-sized. Although this may constitute an exceptional case for the Bronze Age, similar results were reported from the EBA Brixlegg settlement at Mariahilfbergl. Future research is needed to elucidate the possible functional role of dogs in the context of early mining activities.","title":"Continuities and changes of animal exploitation across the Bronze Age – Iron Age boundary at mining sites in the Eastern Alps","creators":[{"firstName":"Konstantina","lastName":"Saliari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Pucher","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Staudt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gert","lastName":"Goldenberg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Alpen"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Kupferbergbau"},{"tag":"Tirol"}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-28T14:32:48Z","dateModified":"2023-10-05T06:15:06Z","itemID":31346,"notes":[],"citationKey":"SaliariEtAl2020ContinuitiesChanges"},{"key":"J8MLGRCH","version":20920,"itemType":"presentation","place":"Innsbruck","date":"2023-09-28","meetingName":"Die Alpen im 1.

These everyday activities leave chemical and geophysical traces in the soil, creating cultural soilscapes. In this book, the author uses the soilscapes from small Late Neolithic and Early Copper Age settlements in the Körös Region of the Great Hungarian Plain to explore the relationship between spatial distributions and community organization during the major social and economic transformations that occurred at the turn of the Neolithic and Copper Age. Focusing on soil, rather than on artifact distributions or architecture, reveals patterns of continuity in spatial organization at small settlements. This contrasts with the spatial organization at large, nucleated Late Neolithic settlements, which differs considerably. The proposed model of household clusters and activity zones provides a framework for understanding shifts in spatial structure as they relate to social organization, and will prove useful in other regions and periods of cultural transformation.","title":"Soilscapes in Archaeology: Settlement and Social Organization in the Neolithic of the Great Hungarian Plain","creators":[{"firstName":"Roderick B.","lastName":"Salisbury","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Raumanalyse"},{"tag":"Bodenkunde"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:58:52Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:58:52Z","itemID":9535,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Salisbury2016SoilscapesArchaeology"},{"key":"J2FSSVUD","version":20163,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://austriaca.at?arp=0x003ddab6","rights":"Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften","volume":"106","pages":"319-334","publicationTitle":"Archaeologia Austriaca","ISSN":"1816-2959, 0003-8008","date":"2022","DOI":"10.1553/archaeologia106s319","accessDate":"2022-12-16T15:20:05Z","libraryCatalog":"austriaca.at","language":"de","abstractNote":"Sediments serve as an archive of human and animal activity and environmental conditions through their physical and chemical properties as well as captured biological traces.

This review paper brings together a range of specialists to introduce cutting-edge approaches to analysing soils and sediments. From the large to the small scale, pioneering methods can complement established soil analytical methods to address issues of soil formation and erosion processes, heritage preservation, mobility, domestication, land use, human-environmental interactions, cultural and biological complexity, and ecosystem legacies.

The structure of the composition of cultivated plants was probably connected to the cultural contacts of human populations. During the Bronze Age (2300/2000–800 BC), the region of South Bohemia (Czech Republic) increasingly became the focus of long-distance trade and exchange networks with regions to the east and many other regions (the Eastern Alps, the Alpine Foreland, the central lowlands of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Western Slovakia). The aim of the paper is to examine archaeobotanical assemblages of charred plant remains to see if these changes within Bronze Age societies, and their spheres of interaction, are also recorded within their agricultural practices. In particular, the importance of specific individual crop species can be reflected in the study region in comparison with other individual regions of Central Europe. Humans in the region of South Bohemia had more connections with the Eastern Alps and the Alpine Foreland region during the Early and Middle Bronze Ages. Regarding the structure of crop species, the composition of sub/dominant crops in South Bohemia and the Eastern Alps and the Alpine Foreland had many similarities. The cultural trajectory of the human populations of the South Bohemian region changed substantially in the Late and Final Bronze Ages: intensive contacts are documented, primarily with the region of Central Bohemia. This is reflected in the composition of the sub/dominant crops in South Bohemia, which shows many similarities to the other regions of the Czech Republic. Changes in migration and exchange networks—in particular those that involved more formalised trade—are associated with a large number of innovations and specific goods and led to much wider levels of cultural and social integration within Bronze Age Europe than had been previously seen.","title":"Crops along the trade routes?

Our study is focused on the reconstruction of the settlement’s structure and character of the environment from which the site drew resources. These research questions were addressed by the interpretation of plant macroremains, charcoals, and the results of the spatial model. We have focused on the maximum size of the settlement that the surrounding countryside was able to withstand. Our results clearly demonstrated significant deforestation and intensive land use in the vicinity of the Late Bronze Age study site. As the weed taxa showed, a wide range of crops was grown in rather dry or less often in damp fields. Based on our archaeobotanical results, we were able to reconstruct several types of grasslands: dry pastures and fallow fields on plateaus and slopes, wet pastures or meadows in the floodplain. Acidophilous oak forests, alluvial forests, and shrubs were reconstructed as the most common forest habitats in the vicinity of the study site. Based on the archaeological knowledge of the region, we assume relatively low population density during the Late Bronze Age, and thus only a small part of the more or less forested landscape was significantly affected by human activities.","title":"Extensive archaeobotanical data estimate carrying capacity, duration, and land use of the Late Bronze Age settlement site Březnice (Czech Republic)","creators":[{"firstName":"Tereza","lastName":"Šálková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Libor","lastName":"Vobejda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ondřej","lastName":"Chvojka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jaromír","lastName":"Beneš","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Václav","lastName":"Vondrovský","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kuna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Křivánek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Menšík","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Novák","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Urnenfelderkultur"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Landnutzung"}],"dateAdded":"2022-12-12T12:36:58Z","dateModified":"2022-12-12T12:36:58Z","itemID":17230,"notes":[],"citationKey":"SalkovaEtAl2022ExtensiveArchaeobotanical"},{"key":"DZIXJ84R","version":8575,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Arch.

It exemplifies how the biologically available Pb method assesses the early lifetime locations of ancient human populations using prehistoric animal teeth and the multivariate/linear nature of Pb isotope data. Lead isotopes provide a valuable technique, in part due to the correlation between their six stable isotope ratios. Other studies have used Pb isotopes for similar purposes, but no clear method for determining a local range has yet been formally defined and tested. The biologically available Pb method uses many prehistoric animal tooth enamel samples to establish a baseline for local ratios in the region, then compares their ratios’ linear patterning to human remains to test if they are non-local. The case study compares Pb isotopes from prehistoric animal teeth, human teeth, and whole rocks from southwest Arkansas. These results are compared to animal samples from Louisiana and Mississippi and human data from Illinois and New Mexico. Soil leachates, Pb concentrations of tooth enamel, and trace element analysis are used to assess contamination. Comparisons to southwest Arkansas whole rock Pb isotope ratios suggest they are too variable to be used for direct comparison to ancient human remains, illustrating that prehistoric animal teeth are more appropriate for direct comparison to prehistoric human teeth. The biologically available Pb method provides a key analysis tool needed for studies of ancient human sourcing.","title":"Biologically available Pb: A method for ancient human sourcing using Pb isotopes from prehistoric animal tooth enamel","creators":[{"firstName":"John R.","lastName":"Samuelsen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Potra","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Bioarchäologie"},{"tag":"Bleiisotopie"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:25Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:25Z","itemID":10736,"notes":[],"citationKey":"SamuelsenPotra2020BiologicallyAvailable"},{"key":"A48YLQ4P","version":4180,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Studien in memoriam W.

For well over a hundred years, the context of use of the c. 300 Iberian stelae known to this date has been intensely discussed. This debate, however, was inherently flawed and limited in its scope, as almost all the available examples were found by chance, and no good-quality empirical evidence was available to understand their primary context. In this paper, we present the first conclusive scientific evidence demonstrating that Iberian late prehistoric stelae were used both as grave markers and landscape landmarks associated with pathways. This incontrovertible evidence stems from fieldwork undertaken in June 2022 and September 2023 at the site of Las Capellanías (Cañaveral de León, Huelva) in south-west Spain, including field walking, geophysics and excavation. The ground-breaking discoveries made at this remarkable site within barely a year reveal the contextual association of three different stelae to as many graves within the context of a large long-standing burial complex. Specifically, in this paper we study Stela #2 through a broad combination of methods ranging from geoarchaeology to luminescence dating and archaeoastronomy, as well as multiple digital visualization and remote sensing techniques. This multidisciplinary approach provides data that reveal multiple lines of evidence concerning the context and temporality of the stela, its manufacture and its graphic design. Altogether, this lays out a much needed and long-awaited reliable empirical base to understand where, when and how Iberian prehistoric stelae were used. “We hewed logs and built his pyre upon the tallest headland where it runs out above the sea: duly we made his funeral, bewailing him with bitter tears. After body and armour were quite burned away, we piled a mound over them and to crown it dragged up a monolith”, Homer, The Odyssey (London, Arcturus, 2021. Trans. by Alexander Pope). “As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning against a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of Dardanus, a ruler in days of old”, Homer, The Illiad (Project Gutenberg, 2022.

Furthermore, why are Bell Beakers adopted in some regions but rejected in others? The starting point for this article is a detailed analysis of a comprehensive selection of potsherds comprising not only Bell Beakers, but also different types of coarse ware found at Bejsebakken, a settlement site in northern Jutland. The intra-site distribution of pottery may reflect learning patterns and, consequently, matrimonial traditions. This has wider implications for our understanding of the social organisation of Late Neolithic society. Finally, this article discusses the directions of influence, rejecting a single source of origin, but arguing that the material culture of the Danish Bell Beaker phenomenon was shaped by many-sided influences.","title":"On the Outskirts of the European Bell Beaker Phenomenon – the Danish Case","creators":[{"firstName":"Torben","lastName":"Sarauw","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Dänemark"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:01:11Z","dateModified":"2021-11-24T09:51:39Z","itemID":9840,"notes":[{"key":"D977X28K","version":10975,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"6FKD375E","note":"<h2>SeriesInformation</h2>\nJournal of Neolithic Archaeology, 9 (2007)","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-11-24T09:49:56Z","dateModified":"2021-11-24T09:50:51Z"}],"citationKey":"Sarauw2007OutskirtsEuropean"},{"key":"RRYUQFQK","version":4194,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Ber.

Here we present the recovery of starches from carbonised ceramic ‘foodcrusts’ from late Mesolithic–early Neolithic residues at the site of Neustadt in northern Germany. A method for investigating background loading of residues with contaminant starches is proposed by comparing interior ‘foodcrusts’ versus exterior ‘sooting’, for the purposes of eliminating samples with insignificant quantities of grains from subsequent identification procedures. The classification of starches to plant taxon is traditionally achieved by manual observations and measurement of nominal and ratio morphological variables. Here, we present a method for the automated classification of granules, using software developed in-house. The results show that when multiple granules are considered, the species selected as modern reference examples can be classified to high levels of specificity. When applied to the archaeological samples we show that wild plant resources persist in importance across the transition to agriculture, with high proportions of granule forms consistent with acorn (Quercus sp.) occurring in all samples. Hazelnut (Corylus avellana) types are less well-represented suggesting it was not an important food in the context of pottery, and may have been over-represented in the repertoire of hunter–gatherer resources.

Also, the metallic character of the samples complicates sample combustion or oxidation. The Erlangen accelerator mass spectrometry group uses an elemental analyzer for the sample combustion, directly followed by a reduction facility. As the carbon content and sample size for iron samples are unsuitable for combustion in an elemental analyzer, 2 alternative approaches are to (a) avoid oxidation and reduction, or (b) extract the carbon from the iron, prior to combustion. Therefore, 2 different pathways were explored. One is direct sputtering of the unprocessed iron sample in the ion source. The other is the complete chemical extraction of carbon from the iron sample and dating of the carbonaceous residue. Also, different methods for cleaning samples and removing contamination were tested. In Erlangen, a Soxhlet extraction is employed for this purpose. Also, the sampling of the iron sample by drilling or cutting can be a source of contamination. Thus, the measurement of iron drill shavings yielded ages that were far too high. The first results for iron samples of known age from 2 archaeological sites in Germany are presented and discussed.","title":"RADIOCARBON DATING OF IRON ARTIFACTS AT THE ERLANGEN AMS FACILITY","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Scharf","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Kretschmer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Morgenroth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Uhl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Kritzler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katja","lastName":"Hunger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ernst","lastName":"Pernicka","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:20Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:20Z","itemID":8355,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ScharfEtAl2004RADIOCARBONDATING"},{"key":"UIS2ECD9","version":4144,"itemType":"journalArticle","date":"2004","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3093","title":"Mikroskopische Untersuchung der Eisenschlacken aus Voitmannsdorf","creators":[{"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Scharff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:39:50Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:39:50Z","itemID":4374,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Scharff2004MikroskopischeUntersuchung"},{"key":"J76RCQCG","version":2045,"itemType":"journalArticle","issue":"180","pages":"219-230","publicationTitle":"Endneolithische Siedlungskeramik aus Ergersheim, Mittelfranken.

From an archaeological perspective, the location of the cemeteries in the Celtic core (Nebringen) and expansion area (Monte Bibele), and the distinctive development of their material culture, suggest that the buried populations had differing mobility rates. On the contrary, the strontium results indicate that only few individuals were mobile or non-local. There is, however, a difference in variation of strontium isotope ratios between the two studied cemeteries, presumably caused by differing geological conditions. In Nebringen changing use of cultivated land in a geologically heterogeneous environment most likely caused varying strontium isotope ratios even within the same jaw, while individual mobility over longer distances can also not be excluded. In Monte Bibele the range of strontium isotope ratios is narrow, and this may be explained by a community living in the same village and using the same agricultural resources. For various prehistoric time periods it has been suggested that some population groups were more mobile than others, for example because they had special social roles. In the two cemeteries studied here, males have slightly more often a non-local birthplace or moved during childhood. In contrast, females had isotope signatures which are more consistent with the local geological environment. Male mobility is, however, not correlated with burial as a warrior, and patrilocal residential patterns were not observed among females. Foreign and local items are found with isotopically local and non-local individuals and objects per se do not indicate descent. The motives for residential changes were, therefore, varied and not constrained to a specific area or population group. The presented dataset provides details on the way of life and land-use in the Celtic communities, for which information is otherwise absent.","title":"Evidence for “Celtic migrations”?
