Although their more settled neighbours often saw them as an ongoing threat and imminent danger--\"barbarians,\" in fact--their impact on sedentary cultures was far more complex than the raiding, pillaging, and devastation with which they have long been associated in the popular imagination. The nomads were also facilitators and catalysts of social, demographic, economic, and cultural change, and nomadic culture had a significant influence on that of sedentary Eurasian civilisations, especially in cases when the nomads conquered and ruled over them. Not simply passive conveyors of ideas, beliefs, technologies, and physical artefacts, nomads were frequently active contributors to the process of cultural exchange and change. Their active choices and initiatives helped set the cultural and intellectual agenda of the lands they ruled and beyond. This volume brings together a distinguished group of scholars from different disciplines and cultural specializations to explore how nomads played the role of \"agents of cultural change.\" The beginning chapters examine this phenomenon in both east and west Asia in ancient and early medieval times, while the bulk of the book is devoted to the far flung Mongol empire of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This comparative approach, encompassing both a lengthy time span and a vast region, enables a clearer understanding of the key role that Eurasian pastoral nomads played in the history of the Old World. It conveys a sense of the complex and engaging cultural dynamic that existed between nomads and their agricultural and urban neighbours, and highlights the non-military impact of nomadic culture on Eurasian history. Nomads as Agents of Cultural Change illuminates and complicates nomadic roles as active promoters of cultural exchange within a vast and varied region. It makes available important original scholarship on the new turn in the study of the Mongol empire and on relations between the nomadic and sedentary worlds.","title":"Nomads as Agents of Cultural Change: The Mongols and Their Eurasian Predecessors","creators":[{"firstName":"Reuven","lastName":"Amitai","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Biran","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Eurasien"},{"tag":"Skythen"},{"tag":"Reiternomaden"},{"tag":"Nomadismus"},{"tag":"Mongolen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:52Z","dateModified":"2021-07-30T07:10:33Z","itemID":8837,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AmitaiBiran2015NomadsAgents"},{"key":"EV8QZA22","version":2199,"itemType":"book","place":"Leiden","publisher":"Sidestone","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5807","abstractNote":"The adoption of agriculture is one of the major developments in human history. Archaeological studies have demonstrated that the trajectories of Neolithisation in Northwest Europe were diverse. This book presents a study into the archaeology of the communities involved in the process of Neolithisation in the Lower Rhine Area (5500-2500 cal BC). It elucidates the role played by the indigenous communities in relation to their environmental context and in view of the changes that becoming Neolithic brought about.\n\nThis work brings together a comprehensive array of excavated archaeological sites in the Lower Rhine Area. Their analysis shows that the succession of Late Mesolithic, Swifterbant culture, Hazendonk group and Vlaardingen culture societies represents a continuous long-term tradition of inhabitation of the wetlands and wetland margins of this area, forming a culturally continuous record of communities in the transition to agriculture.\n\nAfter demonstrating the diversity of the Mesolithic, the subsequent developments regarding Neolithisation are studied from an indigenous perspective. Foregrounding the relationship between local communities and the dynamic wetland landscape, the study shows that the archaeological evidence of regional inhabitation points to long-term flexible behaviour and pragmatic decisions being made concerning livelihood, food economy and mobility. This disposition also influenced how the novel elements of Neolithisation were incorporated. Animal husbandry, crop cultivation and sedentism were an addition to the existing broad spectrum economy but were incorporated within a set of integrative strategies.\n\nFor the interpretation of Neolithisation this study offers a complementary approach to existing research. Instead of arguing for a short transition based on the economic importance of domesticates and cultigens at sites, this study emphasises the persistent traditions of the communities involved. New elements, instead of bringing about radical changes, are shown to be attuned to existing hunter-gatherer practices. By documenting indications of the mentalité of the inhabitants of the wetlands, it is demonstrated that their mindset remained essentially ‘Mesolithic’ for millennia.","title":"Persistent Traditions.

The central aim here is to explore ‘cross-channel’ relationships throughout later prehistory, investigating the archaeological links (material, social, cultural) between the areas we now call Britain and Ireland, and continental Europe, from the Mesolithic through to the end of the Iron Age. Since the separation from the European mainland of Ireland (c. 16,000 BC) and Britain (c. 6000 BC), their island nature has been seen as central to many aspects of life within them, helping to define their senses of identity, and forming a crucial part of their neighbourly relationship with continental Europe and with each other. However, it is important to remember that the surrounding seaways have often served to connect as well as to separate these islands from the continent. In approaching the subject of ‘continental connections’ in the long-term, and by bringing a variety of different archaeological perspectives (associated with different periods) to bear on it, this volume provides a new a new synthesis of the ebbs and flows of the cross-channel relationship over the course of 15,000 years of later prehistory, enabling fresh understandings and new insights to emerge about the intimately linked trajectories of change in both regions.","title":"Continental Connections.

Development-led archaeology, and the often very large areas its excavations expose, has simply revealed many more pits.

Historically it was responsible for three pandemics: the Plague of Justinian in the 6th century AD, which persisted until the 8th century [1]; the renowned Black Death of the 14th century [2, 3], with recurrent outbreaks until the 18th century [4]; and the most recent 19th century pandemic, in which Y. pestis spread worldwide [5] and became endemic in several regions [6]. The discovery of molecular signatures of Y. pestis in prehistoric Eurasian individuals and two genomes from Southern Siberia suggest that Y. pestis caused some form of disease in humans prior to the first historically documented pandemic [7]. Here, we present six new European Y. pestis genomes spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (LNBA; 4,800 to 3,700 calibrated years before present). This time period is characterized by major transformative cultural and social changes that led to cross-European networks of contact and exchange [8, 9]. We show that all known LNBA strains form a single putatively extinct clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny. Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence that suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the early spread of Y. pestis: the pathogen may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia following an expansion of people from the steppe, persisted within Europe until the mid-Bronze Age, and moved back toward Central Eurasia in parallel with human populations.","title":"The Stone Age Plague and Its Persistence in Eurasia","creators":[{"firstName":"Aida","lastName":"Andrades Valtueña","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alissa","lastName":"Mittnik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix M.","lastName":"Key","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Haak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raili","lastName":"Allmäe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrej","lastName":"Belinskij","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mantas","lastName":"Daubaras","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Feldman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rimantas","lastName":"Jankauskas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ivor","lastName":"Janković","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Massy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Novak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Saskia","lastName":"Pfrengle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Reinhold","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Šlaus","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria A.","lastName":"Spyrou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Szécsényi-Nagy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Tõrv","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Svend","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kirsten I.","lastName":"Bos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Philipp W.","lastName":"Stockhammer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Herbig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Krause","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Pest"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Epidemologie"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:02:41Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:02:41Z","itemID":10062,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AndradesValtuenaEtAl2017StoneAge"},{"key":"4P7Q2GVS","version":20717,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2116722119","volume":"119","issue":"17","pages":"e2116722119","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","date":"2022-04-26","journalAbbreviation":"Proc.

Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Eurasian Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period have uncovered key evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor; however, the number of reconstructed LNBA genomes are too few to explore its diversity during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17 Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide geographic expanse across Eurasia. This increased dataset enabled us to explore correlations between temporal, geographical, and genetic distance. Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by rapid dispersal across continents throughout this period, a trend not observed in other pathogens for which ancient genomes are available. A stepwise pattern of gene loss provides further clues on its early evolution and potential adaptation. We also discover the presence of the flea-adapted form of Y. pestis in Bronze Age Iberia, previously only identified in in the Caucasus and the Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this form of Y. pestis. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature of plague’s formative years in terms of its early evolution and ecology.","title":"Stone Age Yersinia pestis genomes shed light on the early evolution,

However, dating of these ancient images, especially of petroglyphs, remains a challenge. In this study, we explore the potential of deriving age estimates from measurements of the areal densities of manganese (DMn) and iron (DFe) in the rock varnish on petroglyphs, based on the concept that the amount of varnish that has regrown on a petroglyph since its creation, relative to the surrounding intact varnish, is a measure of its age. We measured DMn and DFe by portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) on dated Late Pleistocene and Holocene rock surfaces, from which we derived accumulation rates of Mn and Fe in the rock varnish. The observed rates were comparable to our previous findings on basalt surfaces in North America. We derived age estimates for the rock art at four sites in the northern Great Basin region of North America based on DMn measurements on the petroglyphs and intact varnish. They suggest that rock art creation in this region began around the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and continued into the Historic Period, encompassing a wide range of styles and motifs. Evidence of reworking of the rock art at various times by Indigenous people speaks of the continued agency of these images through the millennia.

Dating to the Middle Neolithic (3270–2920 BCE), this settlement is one of the earliest villages that are representative of the social shift in northern Germany, from living in isolated farmsteads in the Early Neolithic towards population agglomeration in villages in the Middle Neolithic. Our results paint a complex picture of the use of grinding and polishing stones in daily plant preparation: they were predominantly used to crush and/or grind cereals, but also regularly used to grind wild grass caryopses, tubers, rhizomes, and, to a lesser extent, wild legumes. We see no significant functional differences among the sampled grinding stone tools linked with different stone morphotypes, stone raw materials, as well as stone sizes. Our results also indicate that daily food processing-related grinding stones may have been deliberately chosen, invested with social meaning, eventually became part of ritual activities in the settlement, and thus, may have additional functions beyond economic practices.","title":"Functional exploration of grinding and polishing stones from the Neolithic settlement site of Oldenburg LA77, Northern Germany − evidence from plant microfossil analysis","creators":[{"firstName":"Jingping","lastName":"An","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Chevalier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan Piet","lastName":"Brozio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wiebke","lastName":"Kirleis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Norddeutschland"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Rückstandsanalyse"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Mahlsteine"},{"tag":"Steingeräte"},{"tag":"Phytolithenanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2025-02-04T11:52:11Z","dateModified":"2025-02-04T11:53:32Z","itemID":33034,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AnEtAl2025FunctionalExploration"},{"key":"QSEQRGAW","version":13035,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-016-0452-7","volume":"9","issue":"4","pages":"673-684","publicationTitle":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","ISSN":"1866-9565","date":"2017","journalAbbreviation":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","DOI":"10.1007/s12520-016-0452-7","abstractNote":"The production of amber ornaments occurred in Italy during the Eneolithic (E)–Early Bronze Age (EBA), although very few beads from the Italian peninsula have been found and analysed.

The amber samples are dated between the Eneolithic and the Final Bronze Age–Early Iron Age and are from the collections of the P. Orsi Museum, in Syracuse (Sicily).

Current evidence indicates that horses were domesticated in the steppes of Kazakhstan and Russia, certainly by 3500 BC and possibly by 4500 BC. Tribal raiding on horseback could be almost that old, but organized cavalry appeared only after 1000 BC. Riding might initially have been more important for increasing the productivity and efficiency of sheep and cattle pastoralism in the western Eurasian steppes. The earliest (so far) direct evidence for riding consists of pathologies on the teeth and jaw associated with bitting, found at Botai and Kozhai 1. Recent developments and debates in the study of bit-related pathologies are reviewed and the reliability of bit wear as a diagnostic indicator of riding and driving is defended.","title":"The Secondary Products Revolution, Horse-Riding, and Mounted Warfare","creators":[{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Anthony","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dorcas","lastName":"Brown","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Secondary products revolution"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:47:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:47:13Z","itemID":6155,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AnthonyBrown2011SecondaryProducts"},{"key":"2NAQXX9B","version":2301,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"48","pages":"134-148","publicationTitle":"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","date":"2017","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6914","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2017.07.004","title":"The dogs of war: A Bronze Age initiation ritual in the Russian steppes","creators":[{"firstName":"David W.","lastName":"Anthony","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dorcas R.","lastName":"Brown","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Eurasien"},{"tag":"Russland"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Hund"},{"tag":"Wolf"},{"tag":"Mythologie"},{"tag":"Srubnaya Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:05:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:05:03Z","itemID":10413,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AnthonyBrown2017DogsWar"},{"key":"BRBYQ5PJ","version":1710,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"2004","pages":"44-45","publicationTitle":"Arch.

Ten crop plants were identified, including cereals (Triticum aestivum/durum/turgidum L., Triticum dicoccum Schübl., Triticum monococcum L., Hordeum vulgare L./distichon L. and Hordeum vulgare var. nudum), legumes (Vicia faba L., Lens culinaris Medik. and Pisum sativum L.) as well as oil plants (Linum usitatissimum L. and Papaver somniferum L.). Two different traditions were observed by looking at the crop assemblages of the early Neolithic (5400–4500 cal BC). It is proposed that one group of farmers settled in the northeastern area of the region and chose to grow free-threshing cereals, especially naked wheat, while a second group settled in the central Catalan coast and along the Llobregat river and included glume wheats as important crops. These different patterns seem to survive during the middle Neolithic period, when naked barley becomes the main crop at some sites, maybe due to contacts with northern groups. The late Neolithic seems to translate into further changes but more investigations are needed. The weed assemblages available are meagre but the lack of indicators for shifting agriculture allowed confirming that crops were sown in permanent fields. It is concluded that early Neolithic settlements must have been more sedentary and farming practices more effort-demanding than previously thought.","title":"The hard knock life.

How fast did these deposits develop? Were they exposed to periodic droughts and decay? Which amount of the originally deposited remains survived until present? Plant macroremains have a great potential as indicators of preservation quality, since they are short-lived and particularly sensible to changes in preservation conditions. This paper reviews previous attempts to use similar proxies to understand layer taphonomy and provides a compilation of almost 50 variables (that include plant macroremains and other remains found in sediment samples) as indicators for preservation quality. Two late Neolithic lakeshore sites located in Central Switzerland were used as tests and more than 100 samples per site were investigated. Samples were grouped into meaningful groups (according to sediment type or their location in the stratigraphy, etc.) and ubiquities were calculated for each variable in each group of samples. Correspondence Analysis was applied in order to establish connections between groups of variables and groups of samples. GIS was used in one of the cases to look at preservation at a site scale. The method proved to be useful and differences in preservation conditions were observed in both sites, not only regarding the location of the samples in the stratigraphy and in relation to their proximity to the lake, but also in connection to sediment type. It is suggested that such studies are necessary before any palaeoeconomic analysis is undertaken.","title":"Studying the preservation of plant macroremains from waterlogged archaeological deposits for an assessment of layer taphonomy","creators":[{"firstName":"Ferran","lastName":"Antolín","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bigna L.","lastName":"Steiner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Örni","lastName":"Akeret","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Brombacher","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marlu","lastName":"Kühn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Vandorpe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Niels","lastName":"Bleicher","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eda","lastName":"Gross","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gishan","lastName":"Schaeren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefanie","lastName":"Jacomet","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Spätneolithikum"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Seeufersiedlung"},{"tag":"Ökologie"},{"tag":"Unterwasserarchäologie"}],"dateAdded":"2017-07-12T09:44:40Z","dateModified":"2021-06-24T10:12:53Z","itemID":256,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AntolinEtAl2017StudyingPreservation"},{"key":"FFWC4MDN","version":8580,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"BAR Int.

This stems partly from the low social value placed upon the elderly in modern societies, which makes us tend to view them as irrelevant, and partly from the difficulty of accurately ageing the skeletons of older individuals, which can make them appear invisible in the archaeological record. A case study from the Traisental of Lower Austria is used to illustrate how the changing meanings of old age are recoverable from archaeological cemetery assemblages. Analysis of material culture patterning is combined with assessment of different forms of bodily degeneration to identify changes over time in the way that old age was socially recognized and the possibility that different kinds of bodily infirmity had very different social implications.","title":"BODIES, BURIALS AND AGEING: ACCESSING THE TEMPORALITY OF OLD AGE IN PREHISTORIC SOCIETIES","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

This is brought to light through ethological studies and the understandings of âworking ridersâ, including the author. Using a case study of the Iron Age Pazyryk human-horse burials, it is then proposed that through this lens the outfits of the horses in the Pazyryk kurgans might be seen to reflect roles and statuses of the horses, rather than of the humans.","title":"Do the clothes make the horse?

Son aspect jaune et brillant est, à l’âge du Bronze particulièrement, symboliquement relié au soleil ; son inaltérabilité, sa très forte densité et sa rareté participent également de sa valorisation. Sur la façade atlantique, de l’Écosse au Portugal, l’âge du Bronze se déroule sur une quinzaine de siècles, environ de 4200 à 2800 avant aujourd’hui. En dépit du recyclage, d’assez nombreux objets en or nous sont parvenus et continuent d’être mis au jour dans cette aire chronoculturelle. L’étude approfondie de ces témoins matériels de sociétés sans écriture constitue, d’une part, une approche de la structuration sociale au travers des liens avec les pratiques des élites, d’autre part avec les compétences technologiques des orfèvres. Parmi les traditions, elle révèle aussi l’émergence d’innovations locales et d’influences méditerranéennes dans le monde atlantique. La maîtrise de la fonderie, de la déformation plastique associée au recuit, des procédés d’assemblage, dont la soudure, et de diverses techniques de décoration, telle la ciselure, a permis la fabrication de bijoux et de vases principalement. L’examen précis des modalités de mise en œuvre des composantes de cette culture technique fait ressortir des évolutions chronologiques, mais également des homogénéités sur l’ensemble de l’aire géographique ou bien des singularités de choix à l’échelle régionale. Cet ouvrage, largement illustré par nombre de photographies originales prises par l’auteure, est aussi une merveilleuse mise en valeur de la recherche esthétique des sociétés anciennes. https://www.chauvigny-patrimoine.fr/Editions/fiche_dossiers.php?sku=MEM054","title":"Les ors de l'Europe Atlantique à l'âge du bronze - technologies et ateliers.","creators":[{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Armbruster","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Gold"},{"tag":"Atlantische Bronzezeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T08:00:47Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T08:00:47Z","itemID":11633,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Armbruster2021OrsEurope"},{"key":"B2KA5PXR","version":17069,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0350-02411969139A","issue":"69","pages":"139-182","publicationTitle":"Starinar","date":"2019","accessDate":"2022-12-21T08:12:18Z","libraryCatalog":"www.doiserbia.nb.rs","abstractNote":"During the first excavations of the cemetery dating from the Bronze Age and Early Antiquity in the village of Velebit near Kanjiža (Northern Serbia) one of the excavated artefacts was found to belong to a used and broken stone mould for casting anvils.

Using case studies from France, Britain and elsewhere, it explores the complex and subtle relationships between power, religion, warfare and violence in Iron Age Europe. 272p, b/w illus (Cambridge UP 2012) 9780521877565 Hb £60.00","title":"Headhunting and the Body in Iron Age Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Armit","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Schädelkult"},{"tag":"Menschenopfer"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:51:13Z","itemID":7590,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Armit2012HeadhuntingBody"},{"key":"TYA6RVYK","version":5473,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2003","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1497","title":"Neolithic Settlement in Ireland and Western Britain","creators":[{"firstName":"I.","lastName":"Armit","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"E.","lastName":"Murphy","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"","lastName":"Nelis.

On the basis of this hypothesis, archaeologists frequently take this to be a universal given. In this article, Ingold's hypothesis is critiqued via an in-depth discussion of the concepts of trust, reciprocity and intimacy.

This book provides the first comprehensive attempt to bring together and provide a comprehensive insight into the latest prehistoric fieldscape research across Europe. The book raises a broader awareness of some of the main questions and scientific requests that are addressed by scholars working in various fieldscapes across Europe. Themes addressed in this book include (a) mapping and understanding field system morphologies at various scales, (b) the extraction of information on social processes from field system morphologies, (c) the relations between field systems and cultural and natural features of their environment, (d) time-depths and temporalities of usage, and (e) specifics of the underlying agricultural systems, with special attention to matters of continuity and resilience and relation to changing practices. The case-studies explore how to best approach such landscapes with traditional and novel methodologies and targeted research in order to enhance our knowledge further. The volume offers inspiration and guidance for the heritage management of fieldscapes heritage not solely for future scholarly research but foremost to stimulate strategic guidance to frame and support improved protection of evidently vulnerable resources for Europes future.

This insight has found a prominent expression in the work of the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen’s so-called capability approach. At the same time, the market-based measure of inequality as a function of the distribution of material remains in graves and other locations remain dominant in archaeology. In this paper, we explore the significance of the capability approach, and the associated concept of human well-being based on the idea of capabilities, to the archaeology of social inequality and social malintegration.

Along with previous excavations of the Danish enclosures at Sarup, these central sites provide a sequence witnessing substantial development of monumental landscapes during a period of relatively low population density in Southern Scandinavia. An explanation for this rather surprising development is placed within a political economy approach: In situations of low-density populations, resource circumscription is thought to be ineffective as a means of political control. Rather, ceremonial monuments were built to create a strong and permanent allure of ritual spaces and ceremonies associated with mortuary practice, inheritance rights, and emergent leaders. Although inherently unstable, positive feedback apparently existed between the collection of food for feasts, labor to build ritual landscapes, and some central power based on authority. The construction of permanent monumental places helped create, we argue, overarching ownership rights represented in the engineered landscape. To demonstrate the generality of these hypothetical relations, the Southern Scandinavian sequence is compared to similar patterns of monumental construction associated with low-density populations during the prehistory of eastern North America.","title":"The construction of monumental landscapes in low-density societies: New evidence from the Early Neolithic of Southern Scandinavia (4000–3300 BC) in comparative perspective (November 5, 2015)","creators":[{"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Artursson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Earle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Brown","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Megalithik"},{"tag":"Hopewell Kultur"},{"tag":"Nordamerika"},{"tag":"Nordeuropa"},{"tag":"Erdwerk"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"},{"tag":"Monumentalität"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:56:40Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:56:40Z","itemID":9233,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ArturssonEtAl2016ConstructionMonumental"},{"key":"TJ8T6YRV","version":1880,"itemType":"book","date":"1960","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1700","title":"The Bronze Age Round Barrow in Britain","creators":[{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Ashbee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:35:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:35:53Z","itemID":2285,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Ashbee1960BronzeAge"},{"key":"DVQL7NI2","version":5798,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"17","pages":"3-50","publicationTitle":"Nachr.

Graves from many periods frequently show signs that others have been digging and have moved or taken away parts of the original funerary assemblage. Displaced bones and artefacts, traces of pits, and damage to tombs or coffins can all provide clues about post-burial activities. The last two decades have seen a rapid rise in interest in the study of post-depositional practices in graves, which has now developed into a new subfield within mortuary archaeology. This follows a long tradition of neglect, with disturbed graves previously regarded as interesting only to the degree they revealed evidence of the original funerary deposit. This book explores past human interactions with mortuary deposits, delving into the different ways graves and human remains were approached by people in the past and the reasons that led to such encounters. The primary focus of the volume is on cases of unexpected interference with individual graves soon after burial: re-encounters with human remains not anticipated by those who performed the funerary rites and constructed the tombs. However, a first step is always to distinguish these from natural and accidental processes, and methodological approaches are a major theme of discussion. Interactions with the remains of the dead are explored in eleven chapters ranging from the New Kingdom of Egypt to Viking Age Norway and from Bronze Age Slovakia to the ancient Maya. Each discusses cases of re-entries into graves, including desecration, tomb re-use, destruction of grave contents, as well as the removal of artefacts and human remains for reasons from material gain to commemoration, symbolic appropriation, ancestral rites, political chicanery, and retrieval of relics. The introduction presents many of the methodological issues which recur throughout the contributions, as this is a developing area with new approaches being applied to analyze post-depositional processes in graves.","title":"Grave Disturbances: The Archaeology of Post-depositional Interactions with the Dead","shortTitle":"Grave Disturbances","creators":[{"firstName":"Edeltraud","lastName":"Aspöck","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Alison","lastName":"Klevnäs","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Müller-Scheeßel","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Grabraub"},{"tag":"Sekundäre Graböffnung"},{"tag":"Bestattungssitten"},{"tag":"Grabritual"}],"dateAdded":"2024-11-01T09:25:41Z","dateModified":"2024-11-01T09:28:49Z","itemID":32862,"notes":[],"citationKey":"AspockEtAl2020GraveDisturbancesa"},{"key":"XUBEKEA6","version":2062,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"3/1991","pages":"49-50","publicationTitle":"AiD","date":"1991","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4034","title":"Bronzezeitliche Besiedlung in Hitzacker","creators":[{"firstName":"J.
