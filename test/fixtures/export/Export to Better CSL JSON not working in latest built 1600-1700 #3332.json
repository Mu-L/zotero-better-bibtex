The author presents a continental-scale study based on a corpus of nearly 600 burials, identifying chronological and geographical patterns. The results emphasise how this elite funerary custom drew on and extended a set of shared aristocratic values and practices across Europe and the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC.","title":"Protohistoric metal-urn cremation burials (1400–100 BC): a pan-European phenomenon","shortTitle":"Protohistoric metal-urn cremation burials (1400–100 BC)","creators":[{"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Desplanques","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Früheisenzeit"},{"tag":"Brandbestattung"},{"tag":"Urnenfelderkultur"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"},{"tag":"Bronzefunde"},{"tag":"_tag_nachtragen"},{"tag":"Bronzegefäße"},{"tag":"Urnenbestattung"}],"dateAdded":"2022-09-05T14:07:32Z","dateModified":"2022-12-06T15:19:31Z","itemID":16903,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Desplanques2022ProtohistoricMetalurna"},{"key":"5FMWDIMQ","version":25982,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Tagungen des Landesmuseums für Vorgeschichte Halle","place":"Halle/Saale","date":"im Druck","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5188","title":"Appendix: Geländeanalyse, Sichtbarkeitsanalyse und 3D-Rekonstruktion","creators":[{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Dette","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"François","lastName":"Bertemes","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Meller","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Religion"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Kreisgrabenanlage"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Kult"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:50:26Z","dateModified":"2024-10-10T11:32:07Z","itemID":7251,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DetteimDruckAppendixGelandeanalyse","publicationTitle":"Der Aufbruch zu neuen Horizonten.

It contained the remains of a young Roman woman so well-preserved that she appeared to have only just died and the sarcophagus was placed on public view, attracting great crowds. Such a find reminds us of the power of the dead body to evoke in the minds of living people, be they contemporary (survivors or mourners) or distanced from the remains by time, a range of emotions and physical responses, ranging from fascination to fear, and from curiosity to disgust. \n\nArchaeological interpretations of burial remains can often suggest that the skeletons which we uncover, and therefore usually associate with past funerary practices, were what was actually deposited in graves, rather than articulated corpses. The choices made by past communities or individuals about how to cope with a dead body in all of its dynamic and constituent forms, and whether there was reason to treat it in a manner that singled it out (positively or negatively) as different from other human corpses, provide the stimulus for this volume. The eight papers provide a series of theoretically informed, but not constrained, case studies which focus predominantly on the corporeal body in death. The aims are to take account of the active presence of dynamic material bodies at the heart of funerary events and to explore the questions that might be asked about their treatment; to explore ways of putting fleshed bodies back into our discussions of burials and mortuary treatment, as well as interpreting the meaning of these activities in relation to the bodies of both deceased and survivors; and to combine the insights that body-centred analysis can produce to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of the body, living and dead, in past cultures.","title":"Death embodied: Archaeological approaches to the treatment of the corpse","creators":[{"firstName":"Zoë L.","lastName":"Devlin","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Emma-Jayne","lastName":"Graham","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Brandbestattung"},{"tag":"Körperbestattung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:02Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:24:26Z","itemID":8608,"notes":[{"key":"ZU226RAQ","version":2667,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"ZTTJHUJ9","note":"<p>Chapter 1.

As not all phytoliths seem to be affected in the same way, these methods are obviously limited and none provide satisfactory results for sufficient discrimination between heated/burned and unheated/unburned phytoliths. We surveyed phytoliths in soil thin sections taken from a variety of modern and archaeological contexts in Northern Europe. Newly formed phytoliths are argued to exhibit no auto-fluorescence. Our observations of combustion features and heated material revealed that phytoliths commonly appear to become auto-fluorescent upon heating. This approach, thus, complements previously developed proxies for heating and burning of phytoliths.","title":"Auto-Fluorescent Phytoliths: A New Method for Detecting Heating and Fire","creators":[{"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Devos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin J.","lastName":"Hodson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vrydaghs","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Feuer"},{"tag":"Phytolithenanalyse"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:42Z","itemID":10833,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DevosEtAl2020AutoFluorescentPhytoliths"},{"key":"KJLHNCYX","version":4069,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"5/1997","pages":"120-123","publicationTitle":"Arch. aktuell im Freistaat Sachsen","date":"1999","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1407","title":"Baltisches Gold aus Kauscha, Weißeritzkreis","creators":[{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"de Vries","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Mitteldeutschland"},{"tag":"Sachsen"},{"tag":"Kultanlage"},{"tag":"Ostdeutschland"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:35:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:35:29Z","itemID":1979,"notes":[],"citationKey":"deVries1999BaltischesGold"},{"key":"8NKXRBVZ","version":21435,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018222002218","volume":"599","pages":"111051","publicationTitle":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","ISSN":"0031-0182","date":"2022-08-01","journalAbbreviation":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111051","accessDate":"2023-10-26T09:36:59Z","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","abstractNote":"The reconstruction of human impact is pivotal in palaeoecological studies, as humans are among the most important drivers of Holocene vegetation and ecosystem change. Nevertheless, separating the anthropogenic footprint on vegetation dynamics from the impact of climate and other environmental factors (disturbances such as fire, erosion, floods, landslides, avalanches, volcanic eruptions) is a challenging and still largely open issue. For this purpose, palynologists mostly rely on cultural indicator pollen types and related indices that consist of sums or ratios of these pollen types. However, the high environmental and biogeographical specificity of cultural indicator plants hinders the application of the currently available indices to wide geographical settings. Furthermore, the achievable taxonomic resolution of cultural indicator pollen types may hamper their indicative capacity. In this study, we propose the agricultural land use probability (LUP) index, a novel approach to quantify human impact intensity on European ecosystems based on cultural indicator pollen types. From the ‘classic’ cultural indicators, we construct the LUP index by selecting those with the best indicator capacity based on bioindication criteria. We first train the LUP index using twenty palynological sequences along a broad environmental gradient, spanning from treeless alpine to subtropical mediterranean evergreen plant communities. We then validate the LUP index using independent pollen datasets and archaeological proxies. Finally, we discuss the suitability of the selected pollen types and the potential of the LUP index for quantifying Holocene human impact in Europe, concluding that careful application of the LUP index may significantly contribute to refining pollen-based land-use reconstructions.","title":"A new indicator approach to reconstruct agricultural land use in Europe from sedimentary pollen assemblages","creators":[{"firstName":"Mara","lastName":"Deza-Araujo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"César","lastName":"Morales-Molino","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Conedera","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul D.","lastName":"Henne","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrik","lastName":"Krebs","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hinz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Caroline","lastName":"Heitz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Hafner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Willy","lastName":"Tinner","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Landnutzung"},{"tag":"Landschaftsentwicklung"},{"tag":"Alpenraum"},{"tag":"Pollenanalyse"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"Europe","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2023-10-26T09:36:59Z","dateModified":"2023-10-26T09:50:15Z","itemID":31480,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Deza-AraujoEtAl2022NewIndicator"},{"key":"Y6UMGAI7","version":2259,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"68","pages":"81-106","publicationTitle":"Sprawozdania Arch.","date":"2016","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6449","title":"The absolute chronology of Late Tripolye sites: a regional approach","creators":[{"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Diachenko","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas K.","lastName":"Harper","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polen"},{"tag":"Ukraine"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Tripolje Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:58:59Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:58:59Z","itemID":9557,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DiachenkoHarper2016AbsoluteChronology"},{"key":"G7JUM3MQ","version":2126,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"39","issue":"8","pages":"2810-2817","publicationTitle":"Journal of Archaeological Science","ISSN":"0305-4403","date":"2012","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4970","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.04.025","abstractNote":"The formation, development and decline of the Tripolye culture giant-settlements in Chalcolitic Ukraine are strictly linked to complex processes of migration and settlement relocation.

This paper argues that the variability in\nlate Neolithic-Chalcolithic enclosures throughout Iberia is a result of the cycling of fission and fusion\ncharacteristic of segmentary social dynamics.","title":"Copper age ditched enclosures in central Iberia","creators":[{"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Díaz-del-Rio","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Befestigung"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Portugal"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:37:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:37:13Z","itemID":3070,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Diaz-del-Rio2004CopperAge"},{"key":"G57QX52W","version":3842,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Trabajos de Prehistoria 61/2, 2004, 85-98","date":"2004","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2441","title":"Factonalism and collective labor in Copper Age Iberia","creators":[{"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Díaz-del-Rio","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:37:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:37:29Z","itemID":3209,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Diaz-del-Rio2004FactonalismCollective"},{"key":"DJKCPFPL","version":4181,"itemType":"book","series":"BAR Int.

In this context, Peircean semiotics – a theory of meaning embedded in experience – helps understanding the unfolding of this meaningful relationship in the past and the present. The case of Bronze Age (ca. 2200-825 BC) decorated stelae and statue-menhirs in the Iberian Peninsula is illustrative. They have been generally conceptualized as static containers of symbolic meanings. But understanding stelae and statue-menhirs as an integral and active part of social relations entails addressing them as signs of practices historically situated within a wider complex network of practices structuring social relations in a meaningful way. Stelae and statue-menhirs suggest multiple indexical relations that can be taken as evidence for social practices related to the structuration of collective identities, memories and places. This approach contributes to a renovated understanding of the historicized relationships between people and this type of remains.","title":"Iconical signs, indexical relations: Bronze Age stelae and statue-menhirs in the Iberian Peninsula","creators":[{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Díaz-Guardamino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Statuenmenhire"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Menhire"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:42Z","itemID":8493,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Diaz-Guardamino2008IconicalSigns"},{"key":"7ZW2DCLR","version":2209,"itemType":"thesis","place":"Madrid","date":"2010","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5915","abstractNote":"This PhD thesis attemps to provide a broad interpretative overview of prehistoric stelae and statue-menhirs on the Iberian Peninsula. It spans from the middle of the 6th Milennium to the 8th-7th centuries BC. The overall objectives of this thesis are: 1. Review current knowledge on prehistoric stelae and statue-menhirs in the Iberian Peninsula; 2. Assess previous interpretations that regard them as part of a unitary phenomenom; 3. Deepen our knowledge on the role of stelae and statue-menhirs in prehistoric social relations. In order to achieve these goals I draw on published work, and, in some cases on data gathered by myself, related to the engravings, stones, stratigraphical contexts, places and regional contexts of stelae and statue-menhirs. The analysis of the data adopts a contextual perspective, as it has a special focus on the formal and material relations in which stelae and statue-menhirs are involved at different scales. This work provides an interpretation of stelae and statue-menhirs as 'ancestors'. This interpretation is based on shared features that are recurrently connoted by stelae and statue-menhirs, their iconographies and contexts, such as the relevance of the Past, of social ties, and their relationship to the landscape. From an ideological point of view, stelae and statue-menhirs are interpreted as mechanisms of social reproduction, as they materialize shared values that, through this medium, are projected in time and space and given continuity. As for the factors that may have been involved in the resort to stelae and statue-menhirs in particular regions during specific periods of time, this thesis proposes a working hypothesis that insists on socioeconomic and conjunctural factors. In order to put the prehistoric stelae and statue-menhirs of the Iberian Peninsula in perspective and to evaluate existing working hypotheses within a broader context, this work concludes with a review of comparable phenomena known in other regions of Europe, some of which offer problems that are similar to the ones encountered in the Iberian Peninsula. Data suggests that the varied broad groupings of stelae and statue-menhirs documented in diverse European regions can be considered analogous phenomena that emerged and developed independently from each other. However, this does not exclude the existence of relationships between some regional traditions that were, most probably, crafted during periods of intense long-distance social interaction.","title":"Las estelas decoradas en la Prehistoria de la Península Ibérica","creators":[{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Díaz-Guardamino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Statuenmenhire"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Menhire"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:42Z","itemID":8495,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Diaz-Guardamino2010EstelasDecoradas","publisher":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"key":"SRETSQ7J","version":2292,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"17","issue":"2","pages":"329-349","publicationTitle":"European Journal of Archaeology","date":"2014","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6801","abstractNote":"This paper assesses the applicability of modern notions of gender identity and individuality, and exam- ines ‘relationality’ as a key dimension structuring social identity during the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Early Iron Age in western Iberia through a focus on funerary practices and stelae- and statue-menhir-making. It is argued that these practices were involved in the recollection of genealogical and mythical pasts. They entailed the creation of the dead and the ancestors as relational entities through the explicit inscription of graphic and spatial relations. Ultimately, these practices were struc- tured by, and structured, shared understandings of the self and the roles of the deceased and the ancestors in social life—understandings in which ‘relationality’ played a seminal role.","title":"Shaping Social Identities in Bronze Age and Early Iron Age Western Iberia: The Role of Funerary Practices, Stelae, and Statue-Menhirs","creators":[{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Díaz-Guardamino","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Statuenmenhire"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Menhire"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:03:46Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:03:46Z","itemID":10244,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Diaz-Guardamino2014ShapingSocial"},{"key":"LFHAAD7L","version":8127,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6061","abstractNote":"This volume explores the pervasive influence exerted by some prehistoric monuments on European social life over thousands of years, and reveals how they can act as a node linking people through time, possessing huge ideological and political significance. Through the advancement of theoretical approaches and scientific methodologies, archaeologists have been able to investigate how some of these monuments provide resources to negotiate memories, identities, and power and social relations throughout European history. The essays in this collection examine the life-histories of carefully chosen megalithic monuments, stelae and statue-menhirs, and rock art sites of various European and Mediterranean regions during the Iron Age and Roman and Medieval times. By focusing on the concrete interaction between people, monuments, and places, the volume offers an innovative outlook on a variety of debated issues. Prominent among these is the role of ancient remains in the creation, institutionalization, contestation, and negotiation of social identities and memories, as well as their relationship with political economy in early historic European societies. By contributing to current theoretical debates on materiality, landscape, and place-making, The Lives of Prehistoric Monuments in Iron Age, Roman, and Medieval Europe seeks to overcome disciplinary boundaries between prehistory and history, and highlight the long-term, genealogical nature of our engagement with the world.","title":"The Lives of Prehistoric Monuments in Iron Age Roman and Medieval Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Diaz-Guardamino","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Garcia Sanjuan","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Wheatley","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Megalithik"},{"tag":"Irland"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Mittelalter"},{"tag":"Statuenmenhire"},{"tag":"Monumentalität"},{"tag":"Bretagne"},{"tag":"henge monuments"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:50Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:24:56Z","itemID":8806,"notes":[{"key":"66NUQDPG","version":2678,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"LFHAAD7L","note":"<p>TOC</p><p>Preface</p><p>List of Figures</p><p>List of Tables</p><p>Contributors</p><p>PART I: INTRODUCTION</p><p>1.

In this research, the latest techniques are applied in order to allow a reconstruction of prehistoric social structure and social organization. Specifically, this investigation uses bioarchaeological methods, such as osteological, paleopathological and biochemical approaches (stable isotopes), in combination with funerary context to reconstruct the mortality, morbidity, dietary and mobility patterns of two human skeletal populations from the Copper Age (c. 3300-2100 cal BC). The main objective was to test whether social differences were already present during the 3rd millennium BC in southern Iberia. For this purpose, two main Copper Age sites, Valencina de la Concepción (Seville) and La Pijotilla (Badajoz), were analysed and then compared to many other contemporary sites from the same geographical location. In sum, the results of this research demonstrate the complexity of the funerary patterns in the Iberian Copper Age, providing evidence for social inequality and differentiation.","title":"The Copper Age in Spain","creators":[{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Diaz-Zorita Bonilla","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"Spanien"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"}],"dateAdded":"2017-07-17T10:26:56Z","dateModified":"2021-07-28T10:53:24Z","itemID":298,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Diaz-ZoritaBonilla2017CopperAge"},{"key":"KGXN342A","version":8600,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/isotopic-evidence-for-mobility-at-largescale-human-aggregations-in-copper-age-iberia-the-megasite-of-marroquies/28929DC1AEF1B35B776A395BD6AD0C0D","volume":"92","issue":"364","pages":"991-1007","publicationTitle":"Antiquity","ISSN":"0003-598X","date":"2018","extra":"Edition: 2018/08/22\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2018.33","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge University Press","abstractNote":"Settlements incorporating large-scale human aggregations are a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon across late prehistoric Europe.

There is clear evidence for horse control from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE in the Carpathian Basin, when antler cheekpieces appear in the archaeological record mostly in the eastern areas. Previous archaeogenomic studies also revealed that the spread of the ancestors of modern day horses began at this time period, but the details of this event in Bronze Age Europe is yet to be uncovered. In this study we report a new shotgun genome (~0.9x coverage) of a Middle Bronze Age horse (radiocarbon dated to 1740-1630 cal. BCE) from Tompa site, southern Hungary, along with six mitochondrial genomes from various sites from Late Copper Age to Early Bronze Age Western Hungary. Our results reveal a strong bottleneck among pre-domestication Carpathian Basin horses and delayed DOM2 introduction into the region compared to the surrounding areas. The population size reduction was most probably due to human mediated loss of natural habitat, but the practice of horsekeeping after the turn of the 2nd millennium BCE can not be excluded based on the genomic data. Our results provide a complex history for horse domestication in the Central-European region, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand the extent and nature of human-horse interactions in this area throughout prehistory.","title":"Genomic refugium of pre-domestication lineages in the Bronze Age Carpathian Basin","creators":[{"firstName":"Zoltán","lastName":"Dicső","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Géza","lastName":"Szabó","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Róbert","lastName":"Bozi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Noémi","lastName":"Borbély","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Botond","lastName":"Heltai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Kulcsár","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Balázs Gusztáv","lastName":"Mende","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Viktória","lastName":"Kiss","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Szécsényi-Nagy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dániel","lastName":"Gerber","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Badener Kultur"},{"tag":"Pferd"},{"tag":"Domestikation"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2023-07-28T09:11:33Z","dateModified":"2023-07-28T09:11:33Z","itemID":31254,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DicsoEtAl2023GenomicRefugium","publisher":"bioRxiv"},{"key":"DY7RG84D","version":3776,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"19/20","issue":"1979/80","pages":"849-916","publicationTitle":"Fundber.

This study reports about prehistoric fire incidents and their impact on the flora and vegetation near the village of Ardez in the Lower Engadine Valley (Switzerland) since the Late Neolithic Period. Pollen, charcoal particles and non-pollen palynomorphs preserved in the Saglias and Cutüra peat bog stratigraphies were quantified and the results compared with the regional archaeological evidence. Anthropogenic deforestation using fire started around 4850 cal. BP at Saglias and aimed at establishing first cultivated crop fields (e.g. cereals) and small pastoral areas as implied by the positive correlation coefficients between charcoal particles and cultural and pastoral pollen indicators, as well as spores of coprophilous fungi. Pressure on the natural environment by humans and livestock continued until 3650 cal. BP and was followed by reforestation processes until 3400 cal. BP because of climatic deterioration. Thereafter, a new, continuous cultivation/pastoral phase was recorded for the Middle to Late Bronze Age (3400?2800 cal. BP). After rather minor human impact during the Iron Age and Roman Period, intensive agriculture was recorded for the Medieval Period. The area around Ardez was used for crop cultivation from about 1000 cal. BP until the start of the ?Little Ice Age? (600 cal. BP). Despite a land-use reorganisation, the following gradual decrease in agricultural activities led to the extant mixture of a cultivated, grazed and forested landscape in the Lower Engadine. In addition, this study demonstrates the excellent value of the fungus Gelasinospora as a highly local marker of past and today?s fire incidents, as well as of the use of micro-charcoals from pollen slides and macro-charcoals (>150?µm) from pollen sample residues for the reconstruction of short- and long-term fire histories.","title":"Neolithic to Bronze Age (4850–3450 cal.

There, pastoral practises began during the Late Neolithic (2300 BC), but alpine dairy farming was directly evidenced so far only since the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (1300?500 BC). The vegetation development, timberline shifts at 2280 m a.s.l. and environmental conditions of the subalpine Urschai Valley (Canton of Grisons, Switzerland) were reconstructed for the small (8 m2) Plan da Mattun fen based on palynological and geochemical analyses for the last six millennia. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses are among the first ones performed on a European peatland in such altitudes. A high Rb/Sr ratio in the fen peat sediments revealed an increase in catchment erosion during the time when the forests of the Upper Urschai Valley were steadily diminished probably by fire and livestock impact (2300?1700 BC). These landscape openings were paralleled by increasing micro-charcoal influx values, suggesting that prehistoric people actively set fire on purpose. Simultaneously, palynological evidence for pastoralism was revealed, such as pollen from typical herbs indicating livestock trampling, and abundant spores from coprophilous fungi. Since then, vertical transhumance and pastoral activities remained responsible for the open subalpine landscape above 2000 m a.s.l., most probably also in the context of milk and dairy production since 1300 BC, which is characteristic for the European Alps until today.","title":"Steady transformation of primeval forest into subalpine pasture during the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (2300−1700 BC) in the Silvretta Alps, Switzerland","creators":[{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Dietre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Reitmaier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Walser","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Theresa","lastName":"Warnk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ingmar","lastName":"Unkel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Irka","lastName":"Hajdas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Lambers","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Reidl","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean Nicolas","lastName":"Haas","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Hsdlg_FbzMbz"},{"tag":"Landschaftsentwicklung"},{"tag":"Alpenraum"},{"tag":"Klima"},{"tag":"Pastoralismus"},{"tag":"Entwaldung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:26Z","dateModified":"2021-11-16T14:07:58Z","itemID":10750,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DietreEtAl2020SteadyTransformation"},{"key":"KR3BQQTZ","version":25491,"itemType":"book","series":"Forschungen und Berichte zur Vor- und Frühgeschichte in Baden-Württemberg","date":"1998","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1823","seriesNumber":"66","title":"Die hallstattzeitlichen Grabfunde aus den Seewiesen von Heidenheim-Schnaitheim","creators":[{"firstName":"H.","lastName":"Dietrich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Süddeutschland"},{"tag":"Gräberfeld"},{"tag":"Hallstattkultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:36:03Z","dateModified":"2024-10-10T12:45:21Z","itemID":2422,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Dietrich1998HallstattzeitlichenGrabfunde"},{"key":"4NXIQ827","version":4486,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"85","issue":"2","pages":"191-206","publicationTitle":"Praehistorische Zeitschrift","ISSN":"0079-4848","date":"2010/12/01","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4284","DOI":"10.1515/pz.2010.011","abstractNote":"The present article is an attempt to uncover the social structures in the South-Eastern Carpathian Basin in the Early and Middle Bronze Age based on observations of the settlement structure and of the distribution of bronze depot finds and isolated finds. Earlier studies have provided many insights into the pottery forms and decorations of the Wietenberg Culture, but so far, no studies have examined their social structures. New detailed mappings of a geographically small area, that of South-Eastern Transylvania, deliver a complex picture characterised by small settlement groups lying at some distance to each other on waterways. They generally consist of several lowland settlements and one or two, sometimes enclosed, hilltop settlements. The hilltop settlements are in close spatial relationship to depot finds and isolated finds of bronze prestige weapons (axes, swords) dating to the same period. In addition, the settlement pattern of hilltop settlements exhibits a clear orientation to the salt springs of the region. New findings have confirmed their use already during the Middle Bronze Age. Both the so-called ?Mycenaean? swords and several elements in the design of the hilltop settlements indicate close contacts with the Grecian world. Salt trade may have played an important role in this context. The Southern Carpathian Basin in the Early and Middle Bronze Age can be seen as an important region of communication whose social elites recognised each other by certain symbols, especially axes and swords.","title":"Eliten der frühen und mittleren Bronzezeit im südöstlichen Karpatenbecken","creators":[{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Dietrich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Rumänien"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Sozialstruktur"},{"tag":"Sozialarchäologie"},{"tag":"Transilvanien"},{"tag":"Wietenberg Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:45:49Z","itemID":5804,"notes":[{"key":"SUMYPFLT","version":2525,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"4NXIQ827","note":"<p>doi: 10.1515/PZ.2010.011</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:45:49Z"}],"citationKey":"Dietrich2010ElitenFruhen"},{"key":"CPSZX53P","version":2150,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Universitätsforsch.

While there is some consensus on seeing hoards as an expression of cultic behaviour, the large ‘scrap metal' hoards in particular still provoke interpretations as raw material collected for recycling. With socketed axes whose sockets were intentionally filled with deliberately fragmented metalwork, Hansen (1996–1998) has pointed out a group of finds that could be crucial to a better understanding of ‘scrap’ hoards. Using the finds from the Carpathian Basin as a case study, a dual biographical approach is applied to this group. A close look at the complex use-life of the objects themselves, as well as an attempt at re-integrating them into the local history of hoarding, leads to the conclusion that they constitute single acts of dedication in larger contexts. “Scrap hoards’” can thus be understood as long-term accumulations of votive objects and can be integrated into the social practice of Bronze Age hoarding.","title":"Learning from ‘Scrap’ about Late Bronze Age Hoarding Practices: A Biographical Approach to Individual Acts of Dedication in Large Metal Hoards of the Carpathian Basin","creators":[{"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Dietrich","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Fragmentierung"},{"tag":"Bronzefunde"}],"dateAdded":"2021-10-05T05:26:06Z","dateModified":"2021-10-05T05:26:06Z","itemID":11853,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Dietrich2014LearningScrap"},{"key":"S65FW7VI","version":4090,"itemType":"book","series":"Universitätsforsch.

Morphometric features of dog mandibles and teeth from Mesolithic – Early Neolithic sites of Vlasac, Padina, Lepenski Vir and Hajdučka Vodenica have been analyzed and compared with recent wolves from the central Balkans. Decrease in size and changes in proportions of dog's dental features were tracked diachronically. We identified specimens which manifested mixed wolf/dog features. Such specimens originate from the Early Mesolithic contexts, the time when a decrease in size began. On the basis of this pattern we suggest that dog domestication may have taken place in the Danube Gorges during the Early Mesolithic (c. 9500–7500 cal. BC). The reduction of size continued throughout Late Mesolithic (c. 7500–6300 cal. BC), but there were still individuals that might be regarded as “transitional” in comparison with wolves on account of their size, and a distinct difference in size between wolves and dogs didn't develop. Accordingly, if local domestication was in progress here, the domestication process might have lasted for more than just few generations and even several millenia.

In this paper, the variation in forest cover in the central Mediterranean\nregion, reflected by percentage changes in the arboreal pollen record, has\nbeen examined in relation to the 4.2 ka event. A total of 36 well-dated\nand detailed pollen records from latitudes between 45 and\n36∘ N were selected and their vegetation dynamics between 5 and 3 ka examined in relation to the physiographic and climatic features of the\nstudy area and to the influence of human activity on past vegetation, as\nsuggested by anthropogenic pollen indicators. We have found that the sites\nlocated between 43 and 45∘ N do not show any significant\nvegetation change in correspondence with the 4.2 ka event. Several sites\nlocated on the Italian Peninsula between 39 and 43∘ N show\na marked opening of the forest, suggesting a vegetation response to the\nclimate instability of the 4.2 ka event. Between 36 and 39∘ N, a forest decline is always visible around 4.2 ka, and in\nsome cases it is dramatic. This indicates that this region was severely\naffected by a climate change towards arid conditions that lasted a few\nhundred years and was followed by a recovery of forest vegetation in the\nMiddle Bronze Age. Human activity, especially intense in southern Italy, may\nhave been favored by this natural opening of vegetation. In Sardinia and\nCorsica, no clear change in vegetation is observed at the same time. We\nsuggest that during the 4.2 ka event southern Italy and Tunisia were under\nthe prevalent influence of a north African climate system characterized by a\npersistent high-pressure cell.","title":"The 4.2 ka event in the vegetation record of the central Mediterranean","creators":[{"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Di Rita","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Magri","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Klimageschichte"},{"tag":"Italien"},{"tag":"4.2k Event"}],"dateAdded":"2021-12-14T22:01:00Z","dateModified":"2021-12-14T22:01:00Z","itemID":12627,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DiRitaMagri2019KaEvent"},{"key":"WSZYDFE6","version":3977,"itemType":"book","series":"Beitr.

Legal and policy approaches differ widely across national and regional contexts, and the attitudes of archaeologists and heritage professionals towards detectorists are often polarized and based on ethical or emotive arguments. We, the European Public Finds Recording Network (EPFRN), have implemented collaborative approaches towards detectorist communities in our respective contexts (Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Flanders, and the Netherlands). Although our motivations are affected by our national circumstances, we base our work on an agreed set of goals, practices, and visions. This article presents the EPFRN's vision statement and provides insight into its underlying thoughts. We hope to create a debate on how to develop best practice approaches that acknowledge the inherent challenges of hobby metal detecting while realizing its potential., La détection de métaux est un loisir sujet à controverses. La réglementation et les lois diffèrent selon les régions et les pays et les attitudes des archéologues et professionnels du patrimoine envers les utilisateurs de détecteurs de métaux sont souvent polarisées et fondées sur des arguments d'ordre éthique voire émotionnel. Le Réseau européen d'enregistrement d'objets découverts par le public (EPFRN) a élaboré des démarches collaboratives envers les utilisateurs de détecteurs de métaux dans les pays où il opère.

Bien que les motivations des auteurs soient influencées par les conditions prévalant dans chaque pays, leur travail repose sur un ensemble d'objectifs, de pratiques et de visions communs.

Translation by Madeleine Hummler, Das Hobby der Sondengängerei ist ein umstrittenes Thema. Die rechtlichen Vorschriften und praktischen Ansätze sind je nach regionalen oder nationalen Voraussetzungen sehr unterschiedlich. Die Einstellungen von Archäologen und Denkmalpflegern gegenüber Sondengängern sind oft polarisiert und stützen sich auf ethische oder sogar emotionale Argumente. Als Europäisches Netzwerk für die Aufnahme von Privatfunden (EPFRN) verfolgen wir den Ansatz einer Zusammenarbeit mit Sondengängern in Dänemark, England, Wales, Finnland, Flandern und den Niederlanden. Obgleich vor dem Hintergrund verschiedener nationaler Voraussetzungen unterschiedlich motiviert, beruht unsere Arbeit auf einer Reihe von gemeinsamen Zielen, Vorgehensweisen und Zukunftsvisionen. Dieser Artikel stellt die Vision des europäischen Netzwerks für die Aufnahme von Privatfunden vor und bietet einen Einblick in die zugrunde liegenden Überlegungen. Damit verbunden ist die Hoffnung, eine Diskussion über die Entwicklung von vorbildlichen Verfahrensweisen anzuregen, mit denen sich sowohl die Herausforderungen der Sondengängerei als auch ihr Potenzial verwirklichen lassen.

Technological innovations including animal traction, the wheel, and plow agriculture transformed the prehistoric economy. The discovery of copper metallurgy expanded the spectrum of socially significant materials and realigned exchange networks away from Neolithic “greenstone,” obsidian, and Spondylus shells. New funerary practices also emerged, signifying the growing importance of lineage ancestors, as well as new ideas of personal identity. These phenomena have long attracted researchers’ attention in continental Europe and the British Isles, but comparatively little has been done in the Italian peninsula. Building on recent discoveries and interdisciplinary research on settlement patterns, the subsistence economy, the exchange of socially valuable materials, the emergence of metallurgy, funerary practices, and notions of the body, I critically appraise current models of the Neolithic-Bronze Age transition in light of the Italian regional evidence, focusing on central Italy. In contrast to prior interpretations of this period as the cradle of Bronze Age social inequality and the prestige goods economy, I argue that, at this juncture, prehistoric society reconfigured burial practices into powerful new media for cultural communication and employed new materials and objects as novel identity markers. Stratified political elites may not be among the new identities that emerged at this time in the social landscape of prehistoric Italy.","title":"From the Neolithic to the Bronze Age in Central Italy: Settlement, Burial, and Social Change at the Dawn of Metal Production","shortTitle":"From the Neolithic to the Bronze Age in Central Italy","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Dolfini","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Italien"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"},{"tag":"Social archaeology","type":1},{"tag":"Chalcolithic","type":1},{"tag":"Copper Age","type":1},{"tag":"Inequality","type":1},{"tag":"Italy","type":1},{"tag":"Late Neolithic","type":1},{"tag":"Prehistoric Europe","type":1}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:25Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:53:30Z","itemID":30885,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Dolfini2020NeolithicBronze"},{"key":"CKZFVCS4","version":27305,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2021.2013307","volume":"53","issue":"5","pages":"809-833","publicationTitle":"World Archaeology","ISSN":"0043-8243","date":"2021-10-20","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2021.2013307","accessDate":"2022-10-17T15:13:56Z","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstractNote":"The article proposes a new interpretation of Chalcolithic and early Bronze Age warrior graves grounded in the ‘Rinaldone’ burial tradition of central Italy, 4th and 3rd millennia BC. In European archaeology, warrior graves are frequently thought to signal the rise of sociopolitical inequality rooted in metal wealth. The work questions the empirical and conceptual foundations of this reading, arguing that, in early Europe, copper was not as rare and valuable as it is often presumed to be; that metalworking did not demand uniquely complex skills; and that metal-rich burials cannot be interpreted in light of modernising ideas of identity. It is argued instead that the key to decoding prehistoric warrior graves lies in context-specific notions of gender, age, and the life course. In particular, life and death circumstances including violence (both inflicted and suffered) would determine why certain individuals were laid to rest with lavish weapon assemblages.","title":"Warrior graves reconsidered: metal, power and identity in Copper Age Italy","shortTitle":"Warrior graves reconsidered","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Dolfini","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Italien"},{"tag":"Kriegerelite"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"},{"tag":"ansehen"},{"tag":"_tablet_ZotMoov"}],"dateAdded":"2022-10-17T15:13:57Z","dateModified":"2025-03-03T16:15:26Z","itemID":16900,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Dolfini2021WarriorGraves"},{"key":"GTJEI3AA","version":1271,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78828-9_1","series":"Quantitative Methods in the Humanities and Social Sciences","place":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","pages":"1-18","ISBN":"978-3-319-78828-9","date":"2018","extra":"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-78828-9_1","accessDate":"2021-06-04T11:28:35Z","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","language":"en","abstractNote":"Archaeological and anthropological research into prehistoric warfare and violence was long framed by two competing meta-narratives harking back to the work of political philosophers Hobbes and Rousseau. Whereas for some researchers violence is a key part of what makes us human, for others it emerges as a result of specific types of socio-political relationships. This contribution explores the ways in which these competing narratives, as well as Europe’s history of twentieth-century warfare, have influenced the way in which we have approached the subject. The paper argues that a turning point came in the wake of Keeley’s renowned monograph (i.e. War before civilization. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996). This has led to the creation of a vibrant field of specialist research on prehistoric warfare and violence. The authors argue that this field of study can be further advanced through interdisciplinary enquiries bringing together state-of-the-art scientific methods of analysis and contemporary theoretical reflections developed in the humanities and social sciences.","title":"Interdisciplinary Approaches to Prehistoric Warfare and Violence: Past, Present, and Future","shortTitle":"Interdisciplinary Approaches to Prehistoric Warfare and Violence","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Dolfini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel J.","lastName":"Crellin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Horn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Uckelmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Dolfini","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Rachel J.","lastName":"Crellin","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Horn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Uckelmann","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Krieg"},{"tag":"Gewalt"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-04T11:28:36Z","dateModified":"2021-06-04T11:28:36Z","itemID":443,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DolfiniEtAl2018InterdisciplinaryApproaches","publicationTitle":"Prehistoric Warfare and Violence: Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches"},{"key":"SRFLWVTZ","version":2316,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"15","issue":"1","pages":"e0227259","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","date":"2020","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7072","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0227259","abstractNote":"The paper discusses results of an interdisciplinary research project integrating lead isotope, chemical, and archaeological analysis of 20 early metal objects from central Italy. The aim of the research was to develop robust provenance hypotheses for 4th and 3rd millennia BC metals from an important, yet hitherto neglected, metallurgical district in prehistoric Europe, displaying precocious copper mining and smelting, as well as socially significant uses of metals in ‘Rinaldone-style’ burials. All major (and most minor) ore bodies from Tuscany and neighbouring regions were characterised chemically and isotopically, and 20 Copper Age axe-heads, daggers and halberds were sampled and analysed. The objects were also reassessed archaeologically, paying special attention to find context, typology, and chronology. This multi-pronged approach has allowed us to challenge received wisdom concerning the local character of early metal production and exchange in the region. The research has shown that most objects were likely manufactured in west-central Italy using copper from Southern Tuscany and, quite possibly, the Apuanian Alps. A few objects, however, display isotopic and chemical signatures compatible with the Western Alpine and, in one case, French ore deposits. This shows that the Copper Age communities of west-central Italy participated in superregional exchange networks tying together the middle/upper Tyrrhenian region, the western Alps, and perhaps the French Midi. These networks were largely independent from other metal displacement circuits in operation at the time, which embraced the north-Alpine region and the south-eastern Alps, respectively.","title":"Copper to Tuscany – Coals to Newcastle?

The project explores whether changes in axe-head design and hafting arrangement from early to late Bronze Age might have been motivated by a desire to improve tool efficiency. The team, comprising researchers with backgrounds in archaeology, engineering, and statistical data modelling, carried out several field and laboratory tests to address the research problem. They subsequently validated the test results through the microscopic analysis of original Bronze Age axe-heads. The data suggest that hafting technology, and especially the resilience of the haft-blade assembly, is more important than axe-head design per se in determining the efficiency and working performance of Bronze Age axes. The research provides a fresh answer to a question rooted in 19th century archaeology and charts an innovative multidisciplinary pathway for studying human technology through the ages.","title":"Testing the efficiency of Bronze Age axes: An interdisciplinary experiment","shortTitle":"Testing the efficiency of Bronze Age axes","creators":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Dolfini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Susan C.","lastName":"Scholes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Collins","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Hardy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas J.","lastName":"Joyce","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Experimentelle Archäologie"},{"tag":"Gebrauchsspurenanalyse"},{"tag":"Beile"},{"tag":"Äxte"}],"dateAdded":"2023-03-13T08:03:12Z","dateModified":"2023-03-13T08:03:12Z","itemID":30951,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DolfiniEtAl2023TestingEfficiency"},{"key":"I8DX2IM6","version":3380,"itemType":"book","series":"Baltic-Pontic Studies 5","place":"Poznań","publisher":"Adam Mickiewicz Univ., Eastern Institute, Institute of Prehistory","date":"1998","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3054","title":"Beyond balkanization","creators":[{"firstName":"Pavel M.","lastName":"Dolukhanov","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lucyna","lastName":"Domaska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Priit","lastName":"Ligi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Osteuropa"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:39:42Z","itemID":4314,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DolukhanovEtAl1998Balkanization"},{"key":"2DIFKXCP","version":4320,"itemType":"book","date":"1960","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1828","title":"Die Siedlung und das Gräberfield in Zengövarkony.
