  {"id":"Hoaglin_1980_poissonness_plot","abstract":"A graphical technique, similar in spirit to probability plotting, can be used to judge whether a Poisson model is appropriate for an observed frequency distribution. This “Poissonness plot” can equally be applied to truncated Poisson situations. It provides a type of robustness for detecting isolated discrepancies in otherwise well-behaved frequency distributions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoaglin","given":"David C."}],"citation-key":"Hoaglin_1980_poissonness_plot","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.1980.10483020","file":"file","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1980,8,1]]},"page":"146-149","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A Poissonness Plot","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1980.10483020","volume":"34"}
