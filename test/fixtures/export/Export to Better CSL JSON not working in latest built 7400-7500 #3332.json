In the south of Greece, in Crete and the Peloponnese, viticulture and wine consumption are mentioned in 2nd millennium bc Linear B texts. Despite the key role of the grapevine, however, little direct archaeobotanical evidence has been available from the Peloponnese until now. This paper reviews all the archaeobotanical Vitis finds from the Peloponnese (pollen, charcoal, grape pips) and adds new data from the site P.O.T.A. Romanou that have been analysed in an integrated study with morphometric analyses of grape pips, charcoal identification and spatial distribution. We are able to show that during the 3rd millennium bc there was an incipient form of grapevine cultivation in the Peloponnese which provided an adequate yield for wine making at P.O.T.A. Romanou. Despite the lack of morphologically domesticated grape pips, there is convincing evidence for the identification of the early steps of viticulture in the region, a process that later led to systematic cultivation under control of the vineyards by elite parts of society during the 2nd millennium bc, as described in the Linear B archives. Our study supports the view that the early stages of viticulture might not be recognisable in the archaeobotanical record.","title":"More than meets the eye: new archaeobotanical evidence on Bronze Age viticulture and wine making in the Peloponnese, Greece","creators":[{"firstName":"Soultana Maria","lastName":"Valamoti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Clémence","lastName":"Pagnoux","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Ntinou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Bouby","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Bonhomme","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean-Frederic","lastName":"Terral","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Ägäis"},{"tag":"Mykenische Kultur"},{"tag":"#Keramikdepot_Melchingen"},{"tag":"Südeuropa"},{"tag":"Wein"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:25Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:06:25Z","itemID":10726,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ValamotiEtAl2020MoreMeets"},{"key":"M55RE3BX","version":13212,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"27","pages":"31-59","publicationTitle":"Acta Arch.

The deer and other quadrupeds represented in the monument are the first unambiguous depictions of prehistoric animals of prehistoric date in Scotland, and among the earliest identified in Britain and Ireland. This contrasts with the well-known abstract carvings of rock art in this region, characterized by cup-marks and cup-and-rings. The discovery also reinforces the special character of Kilmartin Glen as one of the most original and remarkable Neolithic–Bronze Age landscapes of monumentality and rock art in Britain. This article describes the process of authenticating the Dunchraigaig carvings as part of the Scotland's Rock Art Project (ScRAP) and discusses their implications for our understanding of prehistoric rock art in Scotland, Britain and Atlantic Europe more widely.","title":"Revealing the Earliest Animal Engravings in Scotland: The Dunchraigaig Deer, Kilmartin","shortTitle":"Revealing the Earliest Animal Engravings in Scotland","creators":[{"firstName":"Joana","lastName":"Valdez-Tullett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tertia","lastName":"Barnett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Robin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Jeffrey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Schottland"},{"tag":"Felsbilder"},{"tag":"Grabhügel"}],"dateAdded":"2023-01-09T09:49:58Z","dateModified":"2023-01-09T09:49:58Z","itemID":27399,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Valdez-TullettEtAl2022RevealingEarliest"},{"key":"F8SCWWMG","version":2157,"itemType":"book","place":"Bucuresti","publisher":"Ed.

Some of the problems raised by the recent proliferation of these sites in Western Iberia will be discussed. After describing their spatial distribution and chronological span, the dissimilarities with walled enclosures (and amongst ditched enclosures themselves) will be analysed. I shall dispute a homological reductionism and argue in favour of diversified social roles for these kinds of site. Particular attention will be given to size, landscape relationships (terrestrial and celestial), ditch filling processes and associated funerary practices. Finally it will be concluded that the diverse ditched enclosures of South Portugal must be read as an expression of Neolithic cosmogonies. The increasing size and complexity that can be observed in these monuments during the Chalcolithic is interpreted as a “singing of the swan” (the swan song) of those world views, and its abrupt decline, expressed by the apparently rapid disappearance of large ditched enclosures and ditched enclosure architecture as a result of that cosmogonic change","title":"Mind the Gap: Neolithic and Chalcolithic Enclosures of South Portugal","creators":[{"firstName":"António Carlos","lastName":"Valera","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Gibson","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Befestigung"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Portugal"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:58:04Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:58:04Z","itemID":9450,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Valera2012MindGap","publicationTitle":"Enclosing the Neolithic Recent studies in Britain and Europe"},{"key":"XCMMMY8R","version":2254,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"9","pages":"7-12","publicationTitle":"Apontamentos de Arqueologia e Património","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6397","title":"Cronologia absoluta dos fossos 1 e 2 do Porto Torrão e o problema da datação de estruturas negativas “tipo fosso”","creators":[{"firstName":"António Carlos","lastName":"Valera","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Befestigung"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Portugal"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:58:05Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:58:05Z","itemID":9452,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Valera2013CronologiaAbsoluta"},{"key":"SZFMM9DN","version":2255,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"18","pages":"93-110","publicationTitle":"Al-Madam Série II","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6400","title":"Recintos de fossos da Pré-História Recente em Portugal.

We show that all currently investigated LNBA strains form a single genetic clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny that appears to be extinct. Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence, which suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the spread of Y. pestis during the LNBA: Y. pestis may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia during an expansion of steppe people, persisted within Europe until the mid Bronze Age, and moved back towards Central Eurasia in parallel with subsequent human population movements.","title":"The Stone Age Plague: 1000 years of Persistence in Eurasia","shortTitle":"The Stone Age Plague","creators":[{"firstName":"Aida Andrades","lastName":"Valtueña","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alissa","lastName":"Mittnik","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix M.","lastName":"Key","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Haak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Raili","lastName":"Allmäe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrej","lastName":"Belinskij","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mantas","lastName":"Daubaras","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Feldman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rimantas","lastName":"Jankauskas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ivor","lastName":"Janković","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Massy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Novak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Saskia","lastName":"Pfrengle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sabine","lastName":"Reinhold","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Šlaus","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria A.","lastName":"Spyrou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Szecsenyi-Nagy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Tõrv","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Svend","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kirsten I.","lastName":"Bos","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Philipp W.","lastName":"Stockhammer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Herbig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Krause","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Krankheitsgeschichte"},{"tag":"Pest"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Migration"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2017-07-12T08:41:33Z","dateModified":"2021-06-24T10:12:42Z","itemID":254,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ValtuenaEtAl2017StoneAge"},{"key":"HVT3PS7S","version":18828,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003598X22001636/type/journal_article","volume":"97","issue":"391","pages":"120-140","publicationTitle":"Antiquity","ISSN":"0003-598X, 1745-1744","date":"02/2023","journalAbbreviation":"Antiquity","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2022.163","accessDate":"2023-02-22T14:45:42Z","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Bog body studies have focused on rich individual biographies, largely neglecting broader spatial and temporal trends.

This study aimed at filling a gap in the existing literature, both from a geographical as well as a chronological point of view. Additionally, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis on bone and tooth dentine from these individuals was carried out to examine dietary changes between childhood and adulthood. The strontium isotope results revealed four non-local individuals, two from the Neolithic, one from the Early Roman Iron Age and one from the Germanic Iron/Viking Age. We conducted incremental stable isotope analysis of tooth dentine from the four non-local individuals to investigate the palaeodietary information in their dental records at a higher resolution and potentially pinpoint their age at the time of movement. The two Neolithic individuals revealed stable isotope ratios that might be indicative of stress.","title":"Mobility and diet in Prehistoric Denmark: strontium isotope analysis and incremental stable isotope analysis of human remains from the Limfjord area","shortTitle":"Mobility and diet in Prehistoric Denmark","creators":[{"firstName":"Laura G.","lastName":"van der Sluis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.

Nordic distinctiveness entailed an entanglement of cosmology and warriorhood, albeit represented through different media in the hotspot zone (bronze) and in the northern zone (rock). In a Carpathian crossroad between the Eurasian Steppes, the Aegean world and temperate Europe during this time, a transcultural assemblage coalesced, fusing both tangible and intangible innovations from various different places. Superior warriorhood was coupled to beliefs in a tripartite cosmology, including a watery access to the netherworld while also exhibiting new fighting technologies and modes of social conduct. This transculture became creatively translated in a range of hot societies at the onset of the Middle Bronze Age. In southern Scandinavia, weaponry radiated momentous creativity that drew upon Carpathian originals, contacts and a pool of Carpathian ideas, but ultimately drawing on emergent Mycenaean hegemonies in the Aegean. This provided the incentive for a cosmology-rooted resource from which the NBA could take its starting point.","title":"Breakthrough of the Nordic Bronze Age: Transcultural Warriorhood and a Carpathian Crossroad in the Sixteenth Century BC","creators":[{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Krieger"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:57:46Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:57:46Z","itemID":9388,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Vandkilde2014BreakthroughNordic"},{"key":"3VNAQSGB","version":15025,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pz-2016-0005/pdf","volume":"91","issue":"1","pages":"103-123","publicationTitle":"Praehistorische Zeitschrift","ISSN":"1613-0804","date":"2016-06-20","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6361","extra":"Publisher: De Gruyter","journalAbbreviation":"Praehist.

By regarding the Bronze Age as an ancient example of globalisation, Island Melanesia at the outskirts of contemporary globalisation is first examined to provide an analogue to the Nordic entrepreneurial and maritime culture into which metallurgy was first adopted. How did this northern margin become ‘Bronze Age’, and what impact did its inclusion have? Various scales, from local to Bronze-Age-global were found to intersect in the Pile hoard, and in similar sites near and far. By c. 2000 bc, metals and other commodities travelled along well-established local, regional, and super-regional networks, which even incorporated the British Isles and Únětician hubs at the Middle Elbe–Saale. Back in Scandinavia, metal and metal-related culture provided a comparative advantage when navigating local competition for influence and leadership. The transculturally global was strategically appropriated locally, using the reinvention of tradition as a principal strategy. The first metal boom caused friction and slow social change, rather than a social revolution. The real tipping point came in 1600–1500 bc, when the nearly full-blown NBA emerged, through engagement with a considerably expanded world. By this time, large amounts of metal were in circulation. Seen from the non-urban north, this unprecedented expansion of their world brought new opportunities but likely also deep social tensions. Thus, the effects of adopting metallurgy permeated society and connectivity at every level, even at the outskirts of the Bronze Age world.","title":"Bronze Age Beginnings – a Scalar View from the Global Outskirts","creators":[{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:42Z","dateModified":"2025-02-26T20:25:28Z","itemID":10839,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Vandkilde2019BronzeAge"},{"key":"8DGQB98U","version":14927,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Universitätsforschungen zur prähistorischen Archäologie","place":"Bonn","publisher":"Habelt","pages":"31-42","ISBN":"978-3-7749-4248-6","date":"2020","seriesNumber":"350","libraryCatalog":"BnF ISBN","title":"Amber, Weapons and Circulating Ideas about Leadership at the Threshold to the Middle Bronze Age in Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Maran","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Băjenaru","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Sorin-Cristian","lastName":"Ailincăi","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Anca-Diana","lastName":"Popescu","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Svend","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Bernstein"}],"dateAdded":"2022-06-11T10:13:19Z","dateModified":"2022-06-11T10:19:59Z","itemID":16694,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Vandkilde2020AmberWeapons","publicationTitle":"Objects, ideas and travelers: contacts between the Balkans, the Aegean and Western Anatolia during the Bronze and Early Iron Age volume to the memory of Alexandru Vulpe proceedings of the Conference in Tulcea, 10-13 November, 2017"},{"key":"KN796K6K","version":27217,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"BAR Int.

How similar is the imagery found on Sardinia, in southwestern Iberia and southern Scandinavia in material appearance, medium of representation, and sociocultural setting? Does it occur at the same point in time? Does it spring from or transmit a shared idea? Analysis reveals intriguing patterns of similarity and difference between the three zones of horned-helmet imagery 1000–750 BC. The results point to actors and processes at the local level while also pinpointing interconnections. Across all three contexts, horns signify the potency of the helmet wearer, the quintessential warrior. Horns visualise a defined group of bellicose beings whose significance stems from commemorative and mortuary rites, sites, and beliefs – in conjunction with political processes. We suggest that the eye-catching imagery of very particular males wearing horned insignia relates on the one hand to local control of metals and on the other to the transfer of novel beliefs and cults involving embodied gigantisation. It is characteristic that the horned figure is adapted into some settings, but only sparingly or not at all in others. This imagery has a complex history, with Levantine roots in the LBA Mediterranean. The Scandinavian addendum to the network coincides with the metal-led Phoenician expansion and consolidation in the west from c. 1000 BC. A Mediterranean–Atlantic sea route is suggested, independent of the otherwise flourishing transalpine trading route.","title":"Anthropomorphised warlike beings with horned helmets: Bronze Age Scandinavia, Sardinia, and Iberia compared","shortTitle":"Anthropomorphised warlike beings with horned helmets","creators":[{"firstName":"Helle","lastName":"Vandkilde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Matta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Ahlqvist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Heide W.","lastName":"Nørgaard","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Nordische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Iberische Halbinsel"},{"tag":"Kriegerelite"},{"tag":"Kulturkontakte"},{"tag":"Sardinien"},{"tag":"Defensivbewaffnung"},{"tag":"Helme"}],"dateAdded":"2022-01-10T10:07:26Z","dateModified":"2025-01-27T08:11:53Z","itemID":12685,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VandkildeEtAl2021AnthropomorphisedWarlike"},{"key":"XYRLDSNA","version":24700,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pz-2024-2003/html","rights":"De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","volume":"99","issue":"1","pages":"280-338","publicationTitle":"Praehistorische Zeitschrift","ISSN":"1613-0804","date":"2024-06-30","extra":"Publisher: De Gruyter","DOI":"10.1515/pz-2024-2003","accessDate":"2024-07-04T06:27:43Z","libraryCatalog":"www.degruyter.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"Baltic amber is often considered the principal Scandinavian commodity exchanged for metal from ore-rich regions in Europe. If correct, this may explain the astonishing metal wealth of the Nordic Bronze Age and the modest social consumption of amber locally. The hypothesis of a metal-for-amber principle behind the trade is here for the first time assessed on scales from micro to macro. Amber finds were charted across Europe, and the result was then compared to evidence for regular shifts in copper ore preferences/availability, as found in the systematically changing isotopic/elemental composition of Nordic metal objects in c. 2100–1200 BC. Comparisons indicate that amber and metal followed similar spatiotemporal trajectories with major reorganizations at the turn from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age. Shifts in amber distribution correlate with the geography of metal sources used in both periods and flows of metal to Scandinavia and amber to Europe appear to be contingent even in subperiods. Major European amber tracks – and the crossroads hubs controlling them – were identified for the transfer of goods, yet again revealing major changes at the transition to the Middle Bronze Age. The social roles and meanings of amber among Nordic communities were likewise examined, suggesting that bearers of amber played a role in exercising social control of this resource.

This is evident in the selection of agricultural tools for deposition. Agriculture was of course an important collective task. There are also indications that flint knapping took place around the tomb. A third observation concerns the enigmatic scratches on the transverse arrowheads and flakes, forming regular patterns that cannot have a post-depositional origin. Lastly, both the axes and the amber beads ended up in the grave in a used state, indicating a previous life. However, prior to deposition both items were reground, obliterating any traces of individual ownership before they could be deposited in the communal burial ground.","title":"The Materiality of Funnelbeaker Burial Practices: Evidence from the Microscope","creators":[{"firstName":"Annelou","lastName":"van Gijn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"João","lastName":"Marreiros","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Bicho","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Gibaja Bao","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Niederlande"},{"tag":"Bernstein"},{"tag":"Fragmentierung"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Silexartefakte"},{"tag":"Gebrauchsspurenanalyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:43Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:54:43Z","itemID":8775,"notes":[],"citationKey":"vanGijn2014MaterialityFunnelbeaker","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Use-Wear Analysis.

Aware of this problem, microwear analysts have proposed various methods of quantification that use several new analytical techniques. Although useful, these methods, employ overly simple experimentation that does no justice to the unlimited variability of human-object relationships. Instead, it is argued that we have to rely more on interpretation, incorporating ethnographic and ethno-historic information. At the same time we have to improve our daily microwear practice by producing better photographs and studying larger samples. This paper is intended as a general reflection on microwear methodology.","title":"Science and interpretation in microwear studies","creators":[{"firstName":"Annelou","lastName":"van Gijn","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Silex"},{"tag":"Gebrauchsspurenanalyse"},{"tag":"Interpretation"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:15Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:51:15Z","itemID":7627,"notes":[],"citationKey":"vanGijnScienceInterpretation"},{"key":"ZGPXKMY6","version":9203,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41293-z","volume":"9","issue":"1","pages":"4756","publicationTitle":"Scientific Reports","ISSN":"2045-2322","date":"12/2019","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-41293-z","accessDate":"2021-11-14T10:41:53Z","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","language":"en","abstractNote":"the dynamics of the origins and spread of farming are globally debated in anthropology and archaeology. Lately, numerous aDNA studies have turned the tide in favour of migrations, leaving only a few cases in Neolithic europe where hunter-gatherers might have adopted agriculture. It is thus widely accepted that agriculture was expanding to its northern extreme in Sweden c. 4000 BC by migrating Funnel Beaker Culture (FBC) farmers. this was followed by intense contacts with local hunter-gatherers, leading to the development of the pitted Ware Culture (pWC), who nonetheless relied on maritime prey. Here, we present archaeobotanical remains from sweden and the Åland archipelago (Finland) showing that PWC used free-threshing barley and hulled and free-threshing wheat from c. 3300 BC. We suggest that these hunter-gatherers adopted cultivation from FBC farmers and brought it to islands beyond\nthe 60th parallel north. Based on directly dated grains, land areas suitable for cultivation, and absence of signs of exchange with FBC in sweden, we argue that pWC cultivated crops in Åland. While we have isotopic and lipid-biomarker proof that their main subsistence was still hunting/fishing/gathering,\nwe argue small-scale cereal use was intended for ritual feasts, when cereal products could have been consumed with pork.","title":"Maritime Hunter-Gatherers Adopt Cultivation at the Farming Extreme of Northern Europe 5000 Years Ago","creators":[{"firstName":"Santeri","lastName":"Vanhanen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Gustafsson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Håkan","lastName":"Ranheden","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Björck","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marianna","lastName":"Kemell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Heyd","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Spätneolithikum"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Schweden"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"},{"tag":"Finnland"},{"tag":"Pitted Ware Culture"},{"tag":"Grübchenkeramik Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-11-14T10:41:53Z","dateModified":"2021-11-14T10:44:17Z","itemID":12142,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VanhanenEtAl2019MaritimeHunterGatherers"},{"key":"JGMNJTLM","version":18090,"itemType":"thesis","place":"Brno","date":"2008","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6090","abstractNote":"This PhD thesis is focused on introduction and application of molecular genetics methods of sex determination on skeletal remains of children and juvenile individuals from eneolithic burial site Hoštice 1 za Hanou. This unique burial ground of people of bell-shaped beakers culture was discovered in 2002 and belongs to the biggest found in central Europe The aim of this thesis is therefore sex determination based on sex-dependent genetic markers, such as SRY and amelogenin gene. SRY is localized on Y chromosome, codes for testes determining factor and allows direct determination of males. Female samples are thus identified when no amplification product is obtained. Amelogenin gene is localized both on X and Y chromosome and bears deletion in its first intron on X chromosome. Therefore, the PCR amplification of this particular locus can give two different amplification products that can be visualised by agarose electrophoresis. To obtain relevant results, the up-to-date protocols for manipulation with ancient DNA (aDNA) were chosen and optimized. These protocols include contamination free isolation of aDNA, amplification of specific markers and visualization of PCR products. The studied set contained 53 skeletal remains of children or immature individuals in different stages of decay or preservation. By SRY or amelogenin PCR amplification 43 individuals were determined. By both markers 21 individuals were confirmed, in 5 individuals the determination was not possible. Obtained results were discussed with archeological sex determination eg. body imposition or grave inventary.","title":"Určení pohlaví u dětí a nedospělých jedinců z eneolitického pohřebiště Hoštice 1 za Hanou - analýza DNA","creators":[{"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Vaňharnová","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Kind"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Mähren"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:54Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:54:54Z","itemID":8857,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Vanharnova2008UrceniPohlavi","publisher":"Marsarykova Univerzita Brno"},{"key":"QT786P4F","version":18090,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Brno","publisher":"Marsarykova Univerzita Brno","pages":"104-120, 195-196","date":"2011","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6091","title":"Určení pohlaví u dětí prostřednictvím analýza DNA na pohřebiště Hoštice I Za Hanou.

Increasing cultural exchanges affected the economic system. The inhabitants of Switzerland played a pivotal role in this European context through relationships with the Mediterranean, the High and Middle Danube regions and the Alps thanks to the area’s central position. This research aims to reconstruct, for the first time in Switzerland, human socio-economic systems through the study of human diet, herding and farming practices and their changes throughout the Bronze Age (2200–800 BCE) by means of biochemical markers. The study includes 41 human, 22 terrestrial and aquatic animal specimens and 30 charred seeds and chaff samples from sites in western Switzerland. Stable isotope analyses were performed on cereal and legume seeds (δ13C, δ15N), animal bone collagen (δ13Ccoll, δ15N, δ34S), human bone and tooth dentine collagen (δ13Ccoll, δ15N,) and human tooth enamel (δ13Cenamel). The isotopic data suggest a) an intensification of soil fertilization and no hydric stress throughout the Bronze Age, b) a human diet mainly composed of terrestrial resources despite the proximity of Lake Geneva and the Rhone river, c) a diet based on C3 plants during the Early and Middle Bronze Age as opposed to the significant consumption of 13C-enriched resources (probably millet) by individuals from the Final Bronze Age, d) no important changes in dietary patterns throughout an individual’s lifespan but a more varied diet in childhood compared to adulthood, e) no differences in diet according to biological criteria (age, sex) or funerary behavior (burial architecture, grave goods).","title":"Bronze Age innovations and impact on human diet: A multi-isotopic and multi-proxy study of western Switzerland","creators":[{"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Varalli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jocelyne","lastName":"Desideri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mireille","lastName":"David-Elbiali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gwenaëlle","lastName":"Goude","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Honegger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Besse","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:08:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:08:03Z","itemID":11448,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VaralliEtAl2021BronzeAge"},{"key":"W9ZIQNDH","version":18594,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-023-01721-8","volume":"15","issue":"3","pages":"26","publicationTitle":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","ISSN":"1866-9565","date":"2023-02-11","journalAbbreviation":"Archaeol Anthropol Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s12520-023-01721-8","accessDate":"2023-02-20T11:15:49Z","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","language":"en","abstractNote":"The Upper Seine Valley sees during the Bronze Age an increase in settlements and cemeteries characterized by a variety of architectures and funerary practices. This variability originates from the coalescence of two cultural traditions, the Atlantic culture from the northwest and the Continental culture from the east, which find its roots in the Upper Rhine area. In this context, our research aims to understand the cultural identity of these communities by reconstructing subsistence economy and palaeodietary patterns and to trace human mobility, which influenced lifestyle and social–economic dynamics. Adding new 10 AMS dating and using multi-isotope (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S) and multi-proxy (botanical, animal and human remains) biochemical investigations, we detected changes in dietary habits throughout the Bronze Age linked to varying C3 and C4 plant consumption and diverse animal protein intake by humans. Three main outcomes are highlighted: (1) a variety of farming strategies with different manuring intensity according to the cereal species; (2) site-specific dietary patterns; (3) an increase in millet and animal protein intake during the Late Bronze Age. Moreover, results from one cemetery reveal that individual mobility is more significant for males. These dietary variations, differential agricultural strategies and mobility are consistent with other western Europe research, supporting major global changes in all of Europe at the end of the Bronze Age.","title":"Insights into the frontier zone of Upper Seine Valley (France) during the Bronze Age through subsistence strategies and dietary patterns","creators":[{"firstName":"Alessandra","lastName":"Varalli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Peake","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ginette","lastName":"Auxiette","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Balter","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Valérie","lastName":"Delattre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Gouge","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Mordant","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mafalda","lastName":"Roscio","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Françoise","lastName":"Toulemonde","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"André","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Estelle","lastName":"Herrscher","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Isotopenanalyse"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Isotopic analysis"}],"dateAdded":"2023-02-20T11:15:50Z","dateModified":"2023-02-20T11:15:50Z","itemID":30883,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VaralliEtAl2023InsightsFrontier"},{"key":"PZMB2DYV","version":26986,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"54","pages":"37-52","publicationTitle":"Das Altertum","date":"2009","title":"Frau und Pferd in der Spätbronzezeit.

The chemical analyses of glass material from Amarna, Egypt, demonstrate that glass of Mesopotamian origin reached Egypt. The recently obtained physical evidence substantiates the words of the Amarna letters, referring to glass trade between Syria and Egypt. Furthermore, the chemical analyses of glass beads from Romania, Northern Germany and Denmark demonstrate that they were made of Mesopotamian glass. The current results presented here contribute to our understanding of the long distance exchange networks between the Mediterranean and the Nordic Bronze Age cultures. Finally, on the background of the analysis results it is proposed that the chemical composition of some of the beads in question indicates a mixture of glass of Mesopotamian and Egyptian origin. Probably, the mixture of the glass material took place at secondary workshops in the Mycenaean world.","title":"Mesopotamian glass from Late Bronze Age Egypt, Romania, Germany, and Denmark","creators":[{"firstName":"Jeanette","lastName":"Varberg","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Gratuze","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Flemming","lastName":"Kaul","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anne Haslund","lastName":"Hansen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Rotea","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Wittenberger","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Handel"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Nordische Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Mykenische Kultur"},{"tag":"Mesopotamien"},{"tag":"Skandinavien"},{"tag":"Ägypten"},{"tag":"Glasfunde"}],"dateAdded":"2024-01-03T14:45:37Z","dateModified":"2024-01-03T14:46:59Z","itemID":31751,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VarbergEtAl2016MesopotamianGlass"},{"key":"2PBHJ3MP","version":13315,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oa.3102","pages":"oa.3102","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Osteoarchaeology","ISSN":"1047-482X, 1099-1212","date":"2022-03-20","journalAbbreviation":"Intl J of Osteoarchaeology","DOI":"10.1002/oa.3102","accessDate":"2022-03-21T13:22:58Z","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","language":"en","title":"Unusual find of osteolytic lesion on skeleton from the Middle Bronze Age—Possible case of peritoneal abscess","creators":[{"firstName":"Lenka","lastName":"Vargová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ladislava","lastName":"Horáčková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Klára","lastName":"Šabatová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Jarošová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"František","lastName":"Trampota","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alena","lastName":"Němečková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Baldovič","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Patlevičová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kateřina","lastName":"Vymazalová","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Krankheitsgeschichte"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Tschechien"}],"dateAdded":"2022-03-21T13:22:59Z","dateModified":"2022-03-21T13:22:59Z","itemID":16281,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VargovaEtAl2022UnusualFind"},{"key":"M6C38CQS","version":4178,"itemType":"book","place":"Tucson","date":"1999","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2305","title":"Sedentism and Mobility in a Social Landscape.

The method's usefulness for archaeological charcoal is yet to be comprehensively studied. This article details first results from reflectance testing of archaeological charcoals excavated from Irish Bronze Age cremations, which included calcined bone. As calcination of bone commences at 650 °C, it was expected that the charcoals would reflect at least this temperature. This was not the case for taxonomically identified charcoals &gt;2 mm, nor for micro-charcoals of c. 250 μm, although measured temperatures rose slightly with decreasing fraction size of charcoal remains. Depositional practice, combustion completeness and taphonomic influences may have all played a part in this result, and these will need careful consideration in different archaeological circumstances. However, the greatest challenge for reflectance of archaeological materials lies in obtaining full agreement on the production and use of reflectance calibration curves. Current calibration curves differ substantially, by 100–150 °C ( ±50–75 °C) and in one instance up to as much as 180 °C ( ±90 °C). Without better agreement on calibration, the method's ultimate usefulness in archaeological research will be limited. At the level of refinement currently possible, it will still be useful for determining very high or very low temperature processes, and possibly the difference between charcoal fuel and raw wood fuel fires. The latter has distinct implications for estimating ancient forest wood consumption, since more wood is consumed in processes employing charcoal fuel. Proving the utility of reflectance for archaeological purposes may also require modification of normal practice for archaeological field collection of charcoal, to include collection and laboratory processing of un-sieved soil samples.","title":"Reflectance - Current state of research and future directions for archaeological charcoal; Results from a pilot study on Irish Bronze Age cremation charcoals","creators":[{"firstName":"Robyn","lastName":"Veal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lorna","lastName":"O'Donnell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"McParland","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Westeuropa"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Brandbestattung"},{"tag":"Holzkohle"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:59:48Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:59:48Z","itemID":9642,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VealEtAl2016ReflectanceCurrent"},{"key":"S29ABTDV","version":27418,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Mémoires d'Archéologie du Grand-Est","place":"Strasbourg","publisher":"AVAGE","pages":"27-51","date":"2017","seriesNumber":"1","title":"Le Bronze moyen et le début du Bronze final en Alsace: un état des connaissances","creators":[{"firstName":"Cécile","lastName":"Véber","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Billot-Bride","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Michler","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Plouin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Ferrier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Estelle","lastName":"Rault","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sébastien","lastName":"Goepfert","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Logel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Émilie","lastName":"Pascutto","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Lasserre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Fleischer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thibault","lastName":"Lachenal","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Mordant","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Théophane","lastName":"Nicolas","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Cécile","lastName":"Véber","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Siedlung"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"Frankreich"},{"tag":"Hügelgräberkultur"},{"tag":"Elsass"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Hsdlg_FbzMbz"}],"dateAdded":"2022-05-09T09:10:27Z","dateModified":"2025-03-17T10:23:44Z","itemID":16376,"notes":[],"citationKey":"VeberEtAl2017BronzeMoyen","publicationTitle":"Le Bronze moyen et l'origine du Bronze final en Europe occidentale (XVIIe-XIIIe siècle av.
