      "abstractNote": "In medical imaging, radiological scans of different modalities serve to enhance different sets of features for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. This variety enriches the source information that could be used for outcome prediction. Deep learning methods are particularly well-suited for feature extraction from high-dimensional inputs such as images. In this work, we apply a CNN classification network augmented with a FCN preprocessor sub-network to a public TCIA head and neck cancer dataset. The training goal is survival prediction of radiotherapy cases based on pre-treatment FDG PET-CT scans, acquired across 4 different hospitals. We show that the preprocessor sub-network in conjunction with aggregated residual connection leads to improvements over state-of-the-art results when combining both CT and PET input images.",

      "abstractNote": "There is an emerging interest in radiotherapy treatment planning that uses only magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Cur-rent clinical workflows rely on computed tomography (CT) images for dose calculation and patient positioning, therefore synthetic CT images need to be derived from MR images. Re-cent efforts for MR-to-CT image synthesis have focused on unsupervised training for ease of data preparation. However, accuracy is more important than convenience. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for MR-to-CT image synthesis that is trained in a supervised manner. The pro-posed framework utilizes a new hybrid objective function to enforce visual realism, accurate electron density information, and structural consistency between the MR and CT image domains. Our experiments show that the proposed method (MAE of 68.22, PSNR of 22.28, and FID of 0.73) outperforms the existing unsupervised and supervised techniques in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",
