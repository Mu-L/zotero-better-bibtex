Bayesian inference is increasingly used as an alternative to NHST and, in archaeology, is most commonly applied to radiocarbon date estimation and chronology building. This article demonstrates that Bayesian statistics has broader applications. It begins by contrasting NHST and Bayesian statistical frameworks, before introducing and applying Bayes's theorem. In order to guide the reader through an elementary step-by-step Bayesian analysis, this article uses a fictional archaeological faunal assemblage from a single site. The fictional example is then expanded to demonstrate how Bayesian analyses can be applied to data with a range of properties, formally incorporating expert prior knowledge into the hypothesis evaluation process.","title":"Beyond Chronology, Using Bayesian Inference to Evaluate Hypotheses in Archaeology","creators":[{"firstName":"Erik R.","lastName":"Otárola-Castillo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Melissa G.","lastName":"Torquato","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Wolfhagen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matthew E.","lastName":"Hill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Caitlin E.","lastName":"Buck","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bayesische Statistik"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2022-12-21T14:44:34Z","dateModified":"2022-12-21T14:44:34Z","itemID":27313,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Otarola-CastilloEtAl2022ChronologyUsing"},{"key":"3UDBBS3C","version":13210,"itemType":"book","series":"Cahier d'archéologie jurassienne","place":"Porrentruy","publisher":"Office du Patrimoine Historique","ISBN":"2-88436-006-9","date":"1997","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4343","seriesNumber":"7","title":"Le campaniforme d'Alle, Noir Bois (Jura, Suisse)","creators":[{"firstName":"Blaise","lastName":"Othenin-Girard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jehanne","lastName":"Affolter","creatorType":"seriesEditor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Schweiz"},{"tag":"Glockenbecherkultur"},{"tag":"Spätkupferzeit"},{"tag":"Silex"},{"tag":"Silexindustrie"},{"tag":"Alpenraum"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:46:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:46:13Z","itemID":5902,"notes":[{"key":"IAQYXKMX","version":2529,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"3UDBBS3C","note":"<p>Includes bibliographical references<br/>207 p S1 - Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund (GBV) / Verbundzentrale des GBV (VZG) S2 - Bibliothek des Landesamtes für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Sachsen-Anhalt</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:46:13Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:46:13Z"}],"citationKey":"Othenin-Girard1997CampaniformeAlle"},{"key":"NNH32KUT","version":4238,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Arch.

Recent ancient genomic analyses, however, indicate that Botai is not the source of modern domestic horse stock (DOM2 lineage), but is instead related to the Przewalski clade of horses. DOM2 appears to instead to have emerged in early Bronze Age (mid 3rd Mill. BCE) in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and spread quickly replacing other horse lineages after approximately 2,000 BCE. Whilst the specific evidence for earlier husbandry at Botai is not diminished by this evidence, it has broken the consensus regarding the early stages of horse domestication, with some now viewing it as a later event. This paper argues that domestication is rarely an event, but instead a process that is ongoing. The case is made for a “prey pathway” initial phase of domestication in multiple localities during the Eneolithic, which was based around local subsistence pastoralist niche construction. This took different forms due to the presence or absence of ruminant domestic stock in the Eastern European or Central Asian steppes, respectively. Whilst “push” factors likely played a part in the development of horse specialist pastoralism at Botai, it is suggested that “pull” factors accelerated the spread of DOM2 lineages, replacing others, in the later Bronze Age. The DOM2 spread was principally driven, not by local subsistence needs, but wider social, economic and military desirability of equestrianism. The long-term process of horse domestication continues in modernity with major breed changes caused first by the post-medieval agricultural revolution and, more currently, the desire for sporting achievement.","title":"Horse domestication as a multi-centered, multi-stage process: Botai and the role of specialized Eneolithic horse pastoralism in the development of human-equine relationships","shortTitle":"Horse domestication as a multi-centered, multi-stage process","creators":[{"firstName":"Alan K.","lastName":"Outram","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Eurasien"},{"tag":"Pferd"},{"tag":"Steppenvölker"},{"tag":"Reiter"},{"tag":"Domestikation"},{"tag":"Botai Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2023-06-05T08:09:19Z","dateModified":"2023-06-05T08:09:19Z","itemID":31147,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Outram2023HorseDomestication"},{"key":"CUUWZN54","version":4347,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"32","issue":"12","pages":"1699-1710","publicationTitle":"Journal of Archaeological Science","ISSN":"0305-4403","date":"12// 2005","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_5898","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2005.05.008","abstractNote":"Fragmented, co-mingled assemblages of human and animal bones are not uncommon in archaeological deposits, particularly in prehistoric contexts. It is suggested, firstly, that standard approaches to studying the human material do not lend themselves to the complete understanding of such contexts, secondly, that the application of some techniques more common to zooarchaeology are of particular value in understanding such human material, and, thirdly, that fully integrated, identical recording systems for both human and animal material allow for much greater understanding of the relative peri-mortem, depositional and post-depositional histories of human and animal remains in these complex deposits. Such a fully integrated method of recording, that permits direct comparison of the patterning in the human and animal assemblages, is outlined. These methods encompass issues of identification, ageing, quantification, fragmentation, bone fracture analysis, post-depositional taphonomy and evidence of human-induced butchery/trauma and other modifications. The approach is illustrated with examples drawn from the study of the bone deposits at the Middle Bronze Age ritual enclosure of Velim Skalka, Czech Republic.","title":"Understanding complex fragmented assemblages of human and animal remains: a fully integrated approach","creators":[{"firstName":"Alan K.","lastName":"Outram","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Christopher J.","lastName":"Knüsel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Knight","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anthony F.","lastName":"Harding","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Rondell"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Zoologie"},{"tag":"Kreisgrabenanlage"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Fragmentierung"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"Traumatologie"},{"tag":"Sonderbestattung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:38Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:53:38Z","itemID":8460,"notes":[],"citationKey":"OutramEtAl2005UnderstandingComplex"},{"key":"BXA4NKXZ","version":28308,"itemType":"book","series":"Prähistorische Bronzefunde","volume":"3","place":"Stuttgart","publisher":"Franz Steiner","date":"2018","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7008","seriesNumber":"XIX","title":"Die Gießformen in West- und Süddeutschland (Saarland, Rheinland-Pfalz, Hessen, Baden-Württemberg, Bayern)","creators":[{"firstName":"MIchael","lastName":"Overbeck","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Baden-Württemberg"},{"tag":"Metallurgie"},{"tag":"Handwerk"},{"tag":"Südwestdeutschland"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:06:06Z","dateModified":"2025-09-10T10:49:14Z","itemID":10575,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Overbeck2018GiessformenWest"},{"key":"V8AMCFEN","version":3672,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"6","issue":"7","pages":"e22821","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","date":"2011","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4700","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0022821","abstractNote":"<sec> <title>Background</title> <p>Virtually all well-documented remains of early domestic dog (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>) come from the late Glacial and early Holocene periods (ca. 14,000–9000 calendar years ago, cal BP), with few putative dogs found prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 26,500–19,000 cal BP).

It was found that the Razboinichya Cave individual is most similar to fully domesticated dogs from Greenland (about 1000 years old), and unlike ancient and modern wolves, and putative dogs from Eliseevichi I site in central Russia.

Despite evidence of early wine making in the Aegean since the Late Neolithic (ca 4500–4000 BC), the hypothesis of a local domestication of the grapevine in this area hasn't be thoroughly investigated. In order to date the first appearance of the domesticated grapevine and to explore the past cultivated diversity in the Aegean, morphometric analyses were performed on a large data set of 2223 archaeological grape pips from 11 sites located in various areas of Greece and dated to the Late Neolithic, Bronze Age and Archaic period (6th millennium BC - 7th century BC). All the grape pips from the Late Neolithic are morphologically wild. The shift from wild to domesticated shape occurred during the Middle Bronze Age (1900–1700 BC). From the Late Bronze Age (1500–1100 BC) onwards, domesticated types dominate almost all the assemblages. Possible indication of a local domestication process is provided by pips dated to the Early Bronze Age. Also still in the range of modern wild specimens, their shape is an intermediate between the Neolithic pips and those dated to later periods. A high morphological diversity characterizes the Late Bronze Age and Archaic assemblages. These grape pips are mostly allocated to modern varieties from the Balkans, Caucasus and South-West Asia. The geographical origin of the identified varieties may reflect introduction of cultivars from the eastern Mediterranean, but may also testify to an early stage of local domestication and grapevine diversification.","title":"Local domestication or diffusion?

Such techniques are based on thermally or optically stimulated signals. This paper presents simulations of several luminescence techniques for equivalent dose (ED) estimation for ceramic materials containing quartz. The simulations are carried out using a recently published comprehensive kinetic model for quartz, consisting of 11 electron and hole traps and centers. The complete sequence of the experimental protocols for several thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques are simulated using the same set of kinetic parameters. The specific simulated protocols are: additive dose TL protocol, predose technique (both additive and multiple activation versions), phototransfer protocol, single aliquot regenerative optically stimulated luminescence (SAR-OSL) protocol, and SAR thermoluminescence protocol (SAR-TL). One hundred random variants of the natural samples were generated by keeping the transition probabilities between energy levels fixed, while allowing simultaneous random variations of the concentrations of the 11 energy levels. The relative intrinsic accuracy and precision of the protocols are simulated by calculating the equivalent dose (ED) within the model, for a given natural burial dose of the sample. The intrinsic accuracy of these techniques is estimated by simulating natural irradiation of the samples with a known burial dose, followed by simulation of the luminescence method used to recover the estimated dose ED. The percent difference between the burial dose and the ED value represents the simulated accuracy of the luminescence technique. The relative intrinsic precision of these techniques is estimated by fitting Gaussian probability functions to the ED values obtained with the 100 model variants. It is found that the various techniques can reproduce natural paleodoses in the range 10 mGy to 10 Gy with a typical intrinsic accuracy of ±1-10 %. Techniques based on single aliquot protocols were found in general to be more precise than techniques requiring the use of multiple aliquots. In addition, techniques based on interpolation of experimental data were found to be consistently both more precise and accurate than those based on extrapolation of experimental data.","title":"On the intrinsic accuracy and precision of luminescence dating techniques for fired ceramics","creators":[{"firstName":"Vasilis","lastName":"Pagonis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Reuven","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"George","lastName":"Kitis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"OSL-Datierung"},{"tag":"Keramik"},{"tag":"Datierung"},{"tag":"Thermolumineszenz"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:46:17Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:46:17Z","itemID":5931,"notes":[],"citationKey":"PagonisEtAlIntrinsicAccuracy"},{"key":"BA6IM34Z","version":2127,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Arch.

There are still concerns regarding how well formal networks are able to effectively model local interaction. These are often present in the so-called qualitative network approaches—studies that tend to be based on close readings of relations between entities and the way they form dynamic networks of agents. Such studies have demonstrated the value in scrutinizing the way in which relations might be acted on in practice, and how that might differ from expected results. But rarely do such studies produce network data of the kind analyzed by formal network analytical methods. Formal approaches, on the other hand, blur the specificity of individual relations and trade much of their specificity for the ability to make general statements about relations across large datasets. More generally, the modality of the relation/edge is a crucial way in which formal network analysis differs from other prevalent relational approaches popular in archaeology today, where the substantivity of individual relations is paramount. Such relations are often seen as starting points for subsequent hybridizations that radically alter, if only temporarily, the structure of their respective networks. I argue that a key step in allowing networks to reformulate from initial, data-driven network schemata is the introduction of a more symmetrical agency between the node and the edge. In this article, I discuss how ethnographic sources can be used to achieve this for archaeological survey data. I use assemblage theory as a framework to explore the potential the edge has to offer archaeological network modelling. While assemblage theory is helpful for this purpose, the lack of a computational formality to assemblage theory immediately places it at odds with network science. As a complement, I will also employ the computational ontology CIDOC-CRM to more explicitly articulate the character of links between nodes in archaeological networks. The paper will end by suggesting a method of network modelling which integrates the line as a key source of agency. As a nod to Ingold’s call for an increased emphasis on the line, I call this approach network linaeology.","title":"Cutting the Network, Knotting the Line: a Linaeological Approach to Network Analysis","creators":[{"firstName":"Gísli","lastName":"Pálsson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Statistik"},{"tag":"Netzwerkanalyse"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Methode"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T09:07:39Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T09:07:39Z","itemID":11302,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Palsson2020CuttingNetwork"},{"key":"GP7BJLG3","version":3199,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Wien","publisher":"Phoibos","pages":"125-138","date":"2006","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7365","title":"Das minoische Stierspringen.

Jedoch fehlte für die Latènezeit bislang eine groß angelegte Zusammenstellung der Waffen. Die vorliegende Monographie erfasst erstmals alle mittel- und spätlatènezeitlichen Waffen aus Gräbern Kontinentaleuropas. Mit der quellenkritischen Systematisierung der Waffen sowie ihrer Gräber wird ein Überblick über die chorologischen und chronologischen Aspekte dieser Bestattungen gegeben. Die intensive Analyse von 1693 Gräbern mit Waffengabe zeigt, wie sich Eigenheiten und Traditionen ganz verschiedener Bestattungsgemeinschaften innerhalb des großen geographischen Raumes in Anlage und Ausstattung von Grablegen widerspiegeln können. Dabei wird jedoch deutlich, wie komplex der Umgang mit dem Tod ist. Es ist nur wenig von den Vorgängen rund um den Tod überliefert. Deshalb beziehen sich die mit archäologischen Mitteln fassbaren regionalen und chronologischen Unterschiede lediglich auf Details des Brauchtums. Dennoch lässt sich für den Untersuchungszeitraum ein deutlicher Wandel des Rituals ausmachen. Insgesamt ergibt sich, vermutlich durch die Größe des Arbeitsgebietes, eine stärkere Vielfalt als erwartet. Es wird deutlich, dass die überlieferten Spuren des Umgangs mit den Verstorbenen kaum ausreichen, um die tatsächliche Sozialstruktur der damaligen Gesellschaft nachzuzeichnen. Trotzdem sind alle Handlungen des Totenrituals eingebunden in ein soziales System. Dem Archäologen erschließt sich zwar der Zusammenhang zwischen den Grabgaben eines Verstorbenen und seinen sozialen Identitäten, die er zu Lebzeiten besaß, nicht immer, dennoch lässt sich zeigen, dass Waffen den Sozialstatus »Krieger« charakterisieren – wenngleich dies nichts über dessen Position innerhalb eines vertikalen Gefüges aussagt.","title":"Gräber mit Waffengabe der Mittel- und Spätlatènezeitin Kontinentaleuropa","creators":[{"firstName":"Tanja","lastName":"Panke-Schneider","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Krieger"},{"tag":"Späteisenzeit"},{"tag":"Waffen"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:39Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:51:39Z","itemID":7742,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Panke-Schneider2013GraberMit"},{"key":"PH8DFHXX","version":20669,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://archeologickerozhledy.cz/index.php/ar/article/view/110","rights":"Copyright (c) 2022","volume":"74","issue":"4","pages":"462-478","publicationTitle":"Archeologické rozhledy","ISSN":"2570-9151","date":"2022","DOI":"10.35686/AR.2022.22","accessDate":"2023-09-01T08:14:16Z","libraryCatalog":"archeologickerozhledy.cz","language":"cs","abstractNote":"The reconstruction of the grave environment is a key element in the interpretation of the burial rite.

The skeletal remains of four individuals bore traces of deposition in a hollow space. A histological analysis revealed that the decomposition of soft tissues in these individuals must either have been arrested or, in contrast, highly accelerated, since the bone microstructure was not damaged by microorganisms. The decomposition of the bodies could have been accelerated in an open space such as a partially sunken grave with a construction. Alternatively, decomposition could have occurred as the result of higher temperatures in the form of heat or smoke, but also due to a repeatedly waterlogged environment. Specific traces exist on skeletal remains for all of these possibilities. A complex taphonomic analysis of the skeletal remains brings new and more detailed information about the circumstances of the burial, significantly expanding the possibilities of interpreting the concept of death in the past.","title":"Význam histotafonomie a terénní antropologie při rekonstrukci pohřebního ritu kultury se šňůrovou keramikou na Moravě (A taphonomic approach to Corded Ware culture mortuary practices in Moravia)","creators":[{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Pankowská","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"Thanatologie"},{"tag":"Taphonomie"}],"dateAdded":"2023-09-01T08:14:17Z","dateModified":"2023-09-01T08:15:29Z","itemID":31294,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Pankowska2022VyznamHistotafonomie"},{"key":"X2K6L8IR","version":2206,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Kolloquien zur Vor- u.

Along with common grave burials in cemeteries, there is a significant increase in storage pit burials (PBs). PBs are assumed to be a minor deviation from common EBA burial practices. Based on archaeological and skeletal evidence found in contemporaneous pit and grave burials (GBs) within EBA settlements and cemeteries in Moravia, Czech Republic, we present an alternative view that PBs are a social innovation and evidence increasing cultural complexity and gender differentiation. Multidimensional scaling was used to visualise the degree of similarity of the archaeological data, and the relationship of health status to burial location was determined through cross-tabulation. Binary logistic regression was used to predict the odds of being buried in PBs or GBs. Our analyses indicate that in the Moravian EBA community, here are at least two archaeologically visible burial practices, each with different gender treatments. We posit that increased variation in burial practice evidences increasing social differentiation of males from females.","title":"Evidence of innovation and social differentiation in burial practices in Early Bronze Age Moravia","creators":[{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Pankowská","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Monik","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Totenritual"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Mähren"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Sonderbestattung"},{"tag":"Siedlungsbestattung"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:56:36Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:56:36Z","itemID":9227,"notes":[],"citationKey":"PankowskaMonik2017EvidenceInnovation"},{"key":"KZ48VDHR","version":3302,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"104","pages":"13-52","publicationTitle":"Arch.

Studying 271 human genomes dated ~4900 to 1600 BCE from the European heartland, Bohemia, we reveal unprecedented genetic changes and social processes. Major migrations preceded the arrival of “steppe” ancestry, and at ~2800 BCE, three genetically and culturally differentiated groups coexisted. Corded Ware appeared by 2900 BCE, were initially genetically diverse, did not derive all steppe ancestry from known Yamnaya, and assimilated females of diverse backgrounds. Both Corded Ware and Bell Beaker groups underwent dynamic changes, involving sharp reductions and complete replacements of Y-chromosomal diversity at ~2600 and ~2400 BCE, respectively, the latter accompanied by increased Neolithic-like ancestry. The Bronze Age saw new social organization emerge amid a ≥40% population turnover.","title":"Dynamic changes in genomic and social structures in third millennium BCE central Europe","creators":[{"firstName":"Luka","lastName":"Papac","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Ernée","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Dobeš","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michaela","lastName":"Langová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adam B.","lastName":"Rohrlach","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Franziska","lastName":"Aron","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gunnar U.","lastName":"Neumann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria A.","lastName":"Spyrou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadin","lastName":"Rohland","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Velemínský","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kuna","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hana","lastName":"Brzobohatá","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Culleton","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Daněček","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alžběta","lastName":"Danielisová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miluše","lastName":"Dobisíková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Hložek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Douglas J.","lastName":"Kennett","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jana","lastName":"Klementová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Kostka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Krištuf","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Kuchařík","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jana Kuljavceva","lastName":"Hlavová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Limburský","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Drahomíra","lastName":"Malyková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lucia","lastName":"Mattiello","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Pecinovská","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Katarína","lastName":"Petriščáková","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erika","lastName":"Průchová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Stránská","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lubor","lastName":"Smejtek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Špaček","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Radka","lastName":"Šumberová","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ondřej","lastName":"Švejcar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Trefný","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miloš","lastName":"Vávra","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kolář","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Heyd","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Krause","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Pinhasi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Reich","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Schiffels","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Haak","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Mobilität"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Mitteleuropa"},{"tag":"Schnurkeramik"},{"tag":"Migration"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Tschechien"},{"tag":"Böhmen"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Trichterbecherkultur"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2021-09-09T13:27:08Z","dateModified":"2025-02-26T20:25:28Z","itemID":11711,"notes":[],"citationKey":"PapacEtAl2021DynamicChanges"},{"key":"YBDXQAD4","version":10078,"itemType":"bookSection","place":"Athen","pages":"301 ff.","date":"2018","title":"The Iconographic Subject of the Hunt in the Cyclades and Crete in the Second Millennium BC: Sounds and Echoes in the Art of Wall-painting and Vase-painting","creators":[{"firstName":"Andreas G.","lastName":"Vlachopoulos","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Irini","lastName":"Papageorgiou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Kunst"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Ägäis"},{"tag":"Jagd"},{"tag":"Wandmalerei"},{"tag":"Sport"},{"tag":"Ägäische Bronzezeit"}],"dateAdded":"2021-11-19T13:49:27Z","dateModified":"2021-11-19T13:50:16Z","itemID":12314,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Papageorgiou2018IconographicSubject","publicationTitle":"Paintbrushes.

Quantification, however, is generally lacking, and alternative models are rarely tested against the archaeological evidence. In this article, we test the binary hypothesis of gender for prehistoric Central Europe based on a selection of seven published burial sites dating from the Early Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age. Results show that the binary model holds for the majority of individuals, but also supports the existence of non-binary variants. We address such variants as ‘minorities’ rather than ‘exceptions’, as only the former can be integrated in interpretive models. However, we also find that quantification is undermined by several sources of error and systematic bias.","title":"Error or Minority?

However, when it comes to mortuary variability, the difference in body treatments (cremation and inhumation) between populations impairs our ability to carry out regional comparisons and appreciate the range of community social organizations. In this paper, we compare mortuary assemblages from three Bronze Age culture areas on the Great Hungarian Plain. In our coarse quantitative framework, we characterize the intensity of funerary distinction as a proxy for complexity and identify structural variation across mortuary programs. We identify both horizontal and vertical differences in funerary assemblages and note horizontal differences that do not necessarily materialize vertically. The results also show that societies can represent varying values across the different measures, underlying the necessity of working with analytical frameworks which approach the question of complexity in a non-linear manner. We believe that the method offered here can be a useful addition to the toolkit of mortuary archaeologists who work in areas and/or time periods with various body treatment practices.","title":"From the ashes of Bronze Age fires: A framework for comparison across body treatments","shortTitle":"From the ashes of Bronze Age fires","creators":[{"firstName":"Györgyi","lastName":"Parditka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul R.","lastName":"Duffy","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Brandbestattung"},{"tag":"Karpatenbecken"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Körperbestattung"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"#Projekt_Grabhügel_Wunnenstein"},{"tag":"Bestattungssitten"}],"dateAdded":"2023-07-05T09:26:52Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:50:46Z","itemID":31182,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ParditkaDuffy2023AshesBronze"},{"key":"X3JFQ7EU","version":4325,"itemType":"book","date":"1991","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2135","title":"Swords, wagon-graves, and the beginning of the early iron age in Central Europe.

In this chapter, the authors explore variations in cultures across the globe. In some cultures, caregiving responsibilities are commonly distributed among a wide number of individuals beyond the biological parents including siblings, extended family members and nonkin. In many cultures, grandparents, especially grandmothers, play a significant caregiving role either as a supplementary figure who occasionally provides direct care or in cases where the mother is unavailable as the main custodial caregiver. In many cultures aunts and uncles play important and helpful roles in the socialization process. Finally, the chapter highlights that an exploration of other cultures reminds Westerners that the “ideal” family form is not shared by many other cultures.","title":"Many Mothers, Many Fathers, Many Others","creators":[{"firstName":"Ross D.","lastName":"Parke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ross D.","lastName":"Parke","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Ethnografie"},{"tag":"Ethnoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Kulturanthropologie"},{"tag":"Verwandschaft"},{"tag":"Soziale Identität"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:53:28Z","dateModified":"2021-11-19T13:58:58Z","itemID":8399,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Parke2013ManyMothers","publicationTitle":"Future Families: Diverse Forms, Rich Possibilities"},{"key":"Q4VYKABE","version":2093,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"3","issue":"02","pages":"203-229","publicationTitle":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","ISSN":"0959-7743","date":"1993","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_4511","DOI":"doi:10.1017/S0959774300000846","accessDate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","abstractNote":"The dead, collectively or individually, are sometimes powerful forces in human society. At other times they fade into relative insignificance. How archaeologists recover such ideological changes has repercussions for their interpretation of social organization and social change. Interpretations of status, gender, and ranking from funerary deposits are to a large extent dependent on archaeologists' abilities to interpret initially the relationship that the living construct with the dead. This contextual analysis of the Danish Iron Age uses studies of landscape and topography, and contrasts in material culture to situate the changing placement of the dead in society. Their increasing incorporation into the world of the living in the pre-Roman Iron Age indicates a growing concern with lineage and individual status. Later on, within the hierarchical ordering of Roman Iron Age society, the dead retained their significance for the living but in certain regions this was expressed in terms of their communality rather than status differences.","title":"The Powerful Dead: Archaeological Relationships between the Living and the Dead","creators":[{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Parker Pearson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Ritual"},{"tag":"Gräberfeld"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:47:17Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:47:17Z","itemID":6168,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ParkerPearson1993PowerfulDead"},{"key":"YYS8L5RU","version":4176,"itemType":"book","place":"Texas","publisher":"Texas A&M University Press","date":"1999","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2136","title":"Archaeology of Death and Burial","creators":[{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Parker Pearson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Analogie"},{"tag":"Gender"},{"tag":"Sozialstruktur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:36:43Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:36:43Z","itemID":2782,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ParkerPearson1999ArchaeologyDeath"},{"key":"ZLRU9WZP","version":8356,"itemType":"book","series":"BAR Int.

And yet archaeology has been slow to catch on. This is all the more surprising since the ‘bread and butter’ of archaeology are the residues of food preparation and consumption - animal bones, pottery and other containers, cooking places and other technologies of preparation, plant remains (micro and macro), landscapes and settlements, grave goods, etc., etc. This volume of papers arises out of a conference held in Sheffield in 1999, organised jointly by The Prehistoric Society and the Sheffield University Archaeology Society, on ‘Food, Identity and Culture in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age’. The aim was to bring together the different archaeological interests - from archaeological science and humanities perspectives - in food as cultural artefact/ecofact, to examine the potential of the new and developing scientific techniques for reconstructing prehistoric food habits, and to foster an integrated approach to the archaeology of food regardless of different researchers’ specialisms.","title":"Food, Culture and Identity in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age","creators":[{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Parker Pearson","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Bronzezeit"},{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Subsistenz"},{"tag":"Identität"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:53Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T11:06:19Z","itemID":7812,"notes":[{"key":"6VKHZ6S2","version":2625,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"ZLRU9WZP","note":"<p>(1) Food, culture and identity: an introduction and overview<br/>(2) Explaining the dietary isotope evidence for the rapid adoption of the Neolithic in Britain<br/>(3) In the kinship of cows: the social centrality of cattle in the earlier Neolithic of southern Britain<br/>(4) Animals into ancestors: domestication, food and identity in Late Neolithic Orkney<br/>(5) Early Neolithic diets: evidence from pathology and dental wear<br/>(6) The use of dental microwear to infer diet and subsistence patterns in past human populations<br/>(7) You are where you ate: isotopic analysis in the reconstruction of prehistoric residency<br/>(8) Diet and culture in southern Britain: the evidence from Yarnton<br/>(9) Dairying, dairy products and milk residues: potential studies in European prehistory<br/>(10) Neolithic and Early Bronze Age ‘food’ from northern Greece: the archaeobotanical evidence<br/>(11) Changing paradigms: food as a metaphor for cultural identity among prehistoric fisher-gatherer-hunter communities of northern Europe<br/>(12) Mead, chiefs and feasts in later prehistoric Europe.</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:51:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:51:53Z"}],"citationKey":"ParkerPearson2003FoodCulture"},{"key":"9G6SY7HP","version":2221,"itemType":"book","place":"London","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","date":"2013","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6036","abstractNote":"Our knowledge about Stonehenge has changed dramatically as a result of the Stonehenge Riverside Project (2003-2009), led by Mike Parker Pearson, and included not only Stonehenge itself but also the nearby great henge enclosure of Durrington Walls. This book is about the people who built Stonehenge and its relationship to the surrounding landscape. The book explores the theory that the people of Durrington Walls built both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls, and that the choice of stone for constructing Stonehenge has a significance so far undiscovered, namely, that stone was used for monuments to the dead. Through years of thorough and extensive work at the site, Parker Pearson and his team unearthed evidence of the Neolithic inhabitants and builders which connected the settlement at Durrington Walls with the henge, and contextualised Stonehenge within the larger site complex, linked by the River Avon, as well as in terms of its relationship with the rest of the British Isles. Parker Pearson's book changes the way that we think about Stonehenge; correcting previously erroneous chronology and dating; filling in gaps in our knowledge about its people and how they lived; identifying a previously unknown type of Neolithic building; discovering Bluestonehenge, a circle of 25 blue stones from western Wales; and confirming what started as a hypothesis - that Stonehenge was a place of the dead - through more than 64 cremation burials unearthed there, which span the monument's use during the third millennium BC. In lively and engaging prose, Parker Pearson brings to life the imposing ancient monument that continues to hold a fascination for everyone","title":"Stonehenge.

Evidence of mummification is usually limited to a narrow range of arid or frozen environments which are conducive to soft tissue preservation. Mike Parker Pearson and his team show that a combination of microstructural, contextual and AMS 14C analysis of bone allows the identification of mummification in more temperate and wetter climates where soft tissues and fabrics do not normally survive.

This remarkable distance for the movement of megaliths is unparalleled anywhere in the prehistoric world; some geologists have suggested that the bluestones were carried by glaciers in a previous Ice Age but others point out that there is no evidence for past glaciations ever having reached Salisbury Plain or even close to it. This paper proposes that the bluestones were dragged by Neolithic people around 3000 BC, taking a largely overland route except for a crossing of the River Severn. This contrasts with the conventional thinking that the stones were carried on boats across the sea from Milford Haven in south Wales to southern England. It presents evidence for new sources of some of the bluestones on the northern flanks of the Preseli hills, as well as rejecting the long-held notion that the sandstone Altar Stone came from the area of Milford Haven. Finally, it proposes that the Preseli bluestones were selected for transport to Stonehenge because they represented the ancestry of one line of Britain’s earliest farming migrants who arrived in the Preseli region shortly before 4000 BC.","title":"Stonehenge: controversies of the bluestones.

This chapter focuses on the last half a million years with an emphasis on the environmental controls on human dispersal and adaptation, with the perspective of spatiotemporal variations in environments as a key factor. It provides a brief overview of landscapes and their complexity and controls over time and space. Human dispersals and adaptations require an understanding of complex interactions and strong couplings that link human dynamics, biology, biochemistry, geochemistry, geology, hydrology, geomorphology, and atmospheric dynamics, including climate change. The literature is increasingly full of proposals about environmental barriers, glacial/interglacial cycles, sea-crossings, land bridges, and adaptive specializations, but they often lack the means to evaluate their individual and combined impacts on hominid dispersal. The chapter highlights aspects relating to examples of three of these, namely sea level variations, deserts, and mountains.","title":"Environmental Controls on Human Dispersal and Adaptation","creators":[{"firstName":"Adrian G.","lastName":"Parker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Simon J.","lastName":"Underdown","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Landschaftsarchäologie"},{"tag":"Überblick"},{"tag":"Handbuch"},{"tag":"Umweltarchäologie"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2023-12-15T11:10:55Z","dateModified":"2023-12-15T11:15:41Z","itemID":31637,"notes":[],"citationKey":"ParkerUnderdown2023EnvironmentalControls","publicationTitle":"Handbook of Archaeological Sciences"}]}
