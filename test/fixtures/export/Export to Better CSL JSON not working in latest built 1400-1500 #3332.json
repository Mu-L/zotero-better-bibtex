La présence répétée de puits aux cuvelages en bois préservés constitue l'intérêt majeur du site, procurant un corpus de datations dendrochronologiques de référence.\n\nLe site est installé sur la terrasse d'Erstein qui s'étire sur une trentaine de kilomètres au sud de Strasbourg. Elle domine la plaine de l'Ill à l'est et le Bruch de l'Andlau à l'ouest, une zone marécageuse aujourd'hui bien drainée. Épargnée des crues, la terrasse d'Erstein conserve sa couverture de limon éolien, ce qui en fait un territoire très favorable à l'agriculture. Sur ces terres fertiles, les occupations humaines se sont succédé au cours de l'âge du Bronze.\n\nL'ouvrage présente les résultats de la fouille préventive réalisée en 2013 et 2014. Il livre une synthèse des vestiges mis au jour datant du Néolithique final/Bronze ancien à la phase moyenne du Bronze final.\n\nL'ensemble de ces données permet de suivre les rythmes de créations et d'abandons des habitats avec une chronologie fine, et de mieux cerner l'évolution des formes d'appropriation du sol à l'âge du Bronze.

The impressive advance of archaeological research has revealed that, first and foremost, the preeminence of stratified or class society in today’s world is the result of a long social struggle. This volume advances the archaeological study of social organiza- tion in Prehistory, and more specifically the rise of social complexity in European Prehis- tory. Within the wider context of world Prehistory, in the last thirty years, the subject of early social stratification and state formation has been a key subject of interest in Iberian Prehistory.\nThis book describes the different forms of resistance, the interplay between change and continuity, the multiple paths to and from social complexity, and the failures of states to form in Prehistory. It also engages with broader questions, such as: When did social stratification appear in Western European Prehistory? What factors contributed to its emergence and consolidation? What are the relationships between the notions of social complexity, social inequality, social stratification, and statehood? And what are the ar- chaeological indicators for the empirical analysis of these issues? Focusing on Iberia, but with a permanent connection to the wider geographical framework, this book presents, for the first time, a chronologically comprehensive, up-to-date approach to the issue of state formation in prehistoric Europe.","title":"The Prehistory of Iberia.

Against a broader theoretical agenda of both relational materialities and animistic ontologies, it is argued that the qualities and essences of stones dictated their choice and use in monuments. Essentially, it was the hidden natures of stones which gave them meaning, and as archaeologists we can explore this through understanding lithic sourcing, quarrying techniques and the movements of stones, as well as their final resting place within monuments. These ideas are explored through the life history of one monument, that of Blasthill in Kintyre. These ideas are then expanded out to include wood and provide a critique of the wood–stone dichotomy prevalent in current interpretations of Neolithic monumentality.","title":"What lies beneath: Thinking about the qualities and essences of stone and wood in the chambered tomb architecture of Neolithic Britain and Ireland","creators":[{"firstName":"Vicki","lastName":"Cummings","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Britische Inseln"},{"tag":"Großbritannien"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Megalithik"},{"tag":"Jungneolithikum"},{"tag":"Materialstudien"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:48:34Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:48:34Z","itemID":6588,"notes":[{"key":"CTENI7GC","version":2568,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"SIXZ5B6Q","note":"<p>10.1177/1469605311428117</p>","tags":[],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:48:34Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:48:34Z"}],"citationKey":"Cummings2012WhatLies"},{"key":"WPK82PCS","version":2225,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2015","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6080","abstractNote":"By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean is nothing less than the story of how humans first started building the globalized world we know today.

An unashamedly 'big history', it charts the development of European, Near Eastern, and Chinese civilizations and the growing links between them by way of the Indian Ocean, the silk Roads, and the great steppe corridor (which crucially allowed horse riders to travel from Mongolia to the Great Hungarian Plain within a year). Along the way, it is also the story of the rise and fall of empires, the development of maritime trade, and the shattering impact of predatory nomads on their urban neighbours. Above all, as this immense historical panorama unfolds, we begin to see in clearer focus those basic underlying factors - the acquisitive nature of humanity, the differing environments in which people live, and the dislocating effect of even slight climatic variation - which have driven change throughout the ages, and which help us better understand our world today.","title":"By Steppe, Desert and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia","creators":[{"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Cunliffe","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eurasien"},{"tag":"Steppenvölker"},{"tag":"Nomadismus"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:52Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:54:52Z","itemID":8836,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Cunliffe2015SteppeDesert"},{"key":"53XMTD7Y","version":18090,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2012","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_6082","abstractNote":"This book is an exploration of the new idea that the Celtic languages originated in the Atlantic Zone during the Bronze Age, approached from various perspectives pro and con, archaeology, genetics, and philology. This Celtic Atlantic Bronze Age theory represents a major departure from the long-established, but increasingly problematical scenario in which the story of the Ancient Celtic languages and that of peoples called Keltoí Celts are closely bound up with the archaeology of the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures of Iron Age west-central Europe. The Celtic from the West proposal was first presented in Barry Cunliffe's Facing the Ocean (2001) and has subsequently found resonance amongst geneticists. It provoked controversy on the part of some linguists, though is significantly in accord with John Koch's findings in Tartessian (2009). The present collection is intended to pursue the question further in order to determine whether this earlier and more westerly starting point might now be developed as a more robust foundation for Celtic studies. As well as having this specific aim, a more general purpose of Celtic from the West is to bring to an English-language readership some of the rapidly unfolding and too often neglected evidence of the pre-Roman peoples and languages of the western Iberian Peninsula.","title":"Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature","creators":[{"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Cunliffe","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"John T.","lastName":"Koch","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Eisenzeit"},{"tag":"Anthropologie"},{"tag":"Kelten"},{"tag":"Genetik"},{"tag":"Linguistik"},{"tag":"Latènekultur"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:54:52Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T10:21:10Z","itemID":8838,"notes":[{"key":"RXYSRSBG","version":2679,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"53XMTD7Y","note":"<p>Table of Contents</p><p>Part I: Archaeology<br/>1.

It is therefore time to refocus on a narrowing list of ‘suspects’ as possible archaeological proxies for the arrival of this great language family and emergence of its Celtic branch.

In addition, storage is often associated with the development of sedentism and social complexity. Through the use of anthropological and ethnographic data this paper demonstrates that storage by both hunter-gatherers and farmers is more complex. New storage categories, such as closed and open caches, and portable storage, are suggested as ways of understanding whether similar storage practices were used during European prehistory. We learn that although direct evidence for storage is difficult to find in the archaeological record, a combination of ethnographic data and indirect evidence demonstrates that storage, especially this use of small-scale storage, was practiced in prehistory. In the conclusion, this paper demonstrates that storage during the Mesolithic (11,300-6000 BP) would have played a vital role in the lifeways of hunter-gatherers and that for the Neolithic (6000-4500 BP) the use of small-scale storage of a variety of foods would have been equally important as the storage of grain.","title":"Caching your savings: The use of small-scale storage in European prehistory","creators":[{"firstName":"Penny","lastName":"Cunningham","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Ökonomie"},{"tag":"Mesolithikum"},{"tag":"Neolithikum"},{"tag":"Ackerbau"},{"tag":"Ethnoarchäologie"},{"tag":"Vorratswirtschaft"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:45:24Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:45:24Z","itemID":5705,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CunninghamCachingYour"},{"key":"8D9CF4Z2","version":4136,"itemType":"book","place":"Devizes","publisher":"Simpson","date":"1929","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_2528","title":"Woodhenge","creators":[{"firstName":"M.

Aspects of any given food system inform, and are informed by, a variety of social, economic, religious, historical, ecological, cultural, and political processes. Moreover, food systems are often intentionally designed and executed to communicate key aspects of a consumer's identity including class or social status. The manipulation of food systems on the part of socio-political elites or high status individuals is but one example of this phenomenon, the appearance of which is a correlate of increased socio-political hierarchy. As food can come to be used by elites as a socio-political tool in stratified societies, the temptation to use archeologically recognizable differences in foodways as a means of understanding the origin, nature, and functioning of processes of stratification is strong. The obvious difficulty lies in developing theoretically informed methods that reckon food system differences in ways that enable scholars to identify those foods that may have been particularly imbued with social meaning. In this paper, we propose a metric for the identification of elite foods (or, indeed, socially valued foods) using the types of data typically available to archeologists. Based on these proposed criteria, we attempt to unravel the complex and politically charged food system of the stratified societies of the pre-Columbian Greater Antilles with an eye towards refining our understanding of the development and maintenance of prestige and institutionalized power therein.","title":"Identifying high-status foods in the archeological record","creators":[{"firstName":"L.

Nevertheless, in the 1960s and 1970s, feminist approaches dethroned the idea of the Mother Goddess as the key organizing principle of Aegean Neolithic societies. Recently, however, certain versions of gynecocracy, implying female rule, and/or of matrilineal kinship have been rethroned for studies in the Aegean Neolithic and Bronze Age. This article critically assesses how and why scholars have supported the existence of matrilineal kinship and/or female rule in the Aegean Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Which pools of evidence have they used to support their claims and why? The multiple lives of matrilineal kinship and female rule in the research record will be discussed through the lens of enthroning, dethroning and rethroning processes. Ultimately, tracing these processes helps to elucidate the troubled relationship between translating socio-cultural anthropological concepts with and without applying socio-cultural anthropological knowledge to the archaeological material.","title":"Enthrone, dethrone, rethrone?

From a sociocultural anthropological perspective, however, the two terms are not as simple and unproblematic as is widely accepted among archaeogeneticists. Matriliny and patriliny are umbrella terms for societies with a wide range of political and kinship practices, with or without a state. Moreover, archaeogenetic literature has assumed specific associations with matrilineal and patrilineal descent that are not supported by sociocultural anthropology. To properly understand the diversity of human sociopolitical forms in both the deep and recent past, archaeology – in its broadest sense, including archaeogenetics – must avoid essentializing prehistoric communities without exploring the empirical nuances that are well documented ethnographically. Finally, the article calls for more engagement in debates on kinship and sociopolitical organization in prehistory from sociocultural anthropological perspectives.","title":"Why kinship still needs anthropologists in the 21st century","creators":[{"firstName":"Sabina","lastName":"Cveček","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Theorie"},{"tag":"Soziale Organisation"},{"tag":"Sozialanthropologie"},{"tag":"Verwandschaft"},{"tag":"Methode"},{"tag":"aDNA-Analyse"}],"dateAdded":"2024-02-05T10:08:01Z","dateModified":"2024-02-05T10:08:38Z","itemID":31777,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Cvecek2024WhyKinship"},{"key":"MUEN3SSI","version":12204,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Baltic-Pontic Studies","place":"Poznań","pages":"165-189","date":"1998","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_3669","seriesNumber":"6","title":"\"Trzciniec\".

While in the Circum-Harz group and in Silesia similar rich furnished graves under mounds have appeared as single monuments as early as 1950 BC, Łęki Małe represents a chain of barrows constructed between 2150 BC and 1800 BC. Of the original 14 mounds, only four were preserved well enough that their complex biographies can now be reconstructed. They included ritual activities (before, during, and after the funeral), and also subsequent incursions, including robberies. The long lasting barrow cemetery at Łęki Małe can be linked to a nearby fortified site, Bruszczewo. Together, Łęki Małe and Bruszczewo represent a stable, socially differentiated society that existed for no less than 350–400 years. Therefore, it can be argued that the Early Bronze Age societies of Greater Poland were extremely sustainable in comparison to those of other Únětice regions.","title":"Chronology and social significance of the “princely” barrow cemetery in Łęki Małe and the Central European Early Bronze Age","creators":[{"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Czebreszuk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Müller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marzena","lastName":"Szmyt","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Goslar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Jaeger","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iwona","lastName":"Hildebrandt-Radke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Niebieszczański","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Gmińska-Nowak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ważny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jutta","lastName":"Kneisel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Krause-Kyora","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Makowiecki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Rewekant","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadiia","lastName":"Kotova","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Rennwanz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Raese","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Soziale Stratifizierung"},{"tag":"Polen"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Aunjetitzer Kultur"},{"tag":"Radiokarbondatierung"},{"tag":"Fürstengrab"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Hügelkonstruktion"},{"tag":"Genealogie"},{"tag":"Dendrochronologie"},{"tag":"Grabhügel"},{"tag":"Soziale Identität"},{"tag":"ansehen"}],"dateAdded":"2024-06-05T10:46:25Z","dateModified":"2024-11-14T08:37:41Z","itemID":32283,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CzebreszukEtAl2024ChronologySocial"},{"key":"UQ88EFVE","version":8105,"itemType":"book","series":"Stud. zur Arch. in Ostmitteleuropa","place":"Rahden/Westf.","date":"2001","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1808","seriesNumber":"1","title":"Die absolute Chronology in Mitteleuropa 3000-2000 v.

However, some features discovered in recent years de- monstrate more complex situations. These  nds shed new light on the features known in archaeology. This paper analyses 9 examples of the CWC burial sites in Central Europe attempting to show a different — than the above described — image of the sepulchral activity of the CWC societies. The paper suggests reconstructions of ritual scenarios (or, sequences of ritual acts), whose physical effects are observable on the sites under discus- sion. The conducted analysis leads to the conclusion that the occurrence of a mound or of a circular ditch with a pali- sade on a particular site was often one of the elements of an entire cycle of ritual practices, lasting over a long pe- riod of time. The act of burial alone in such scenarios was only one of the important episodes. It is noteworthy that in those scenarios the societies of the CWC circle used only a very limited number of means of expression. Among them, apart from the burial pit itself, there were such elements as a circular ditch, a mound and a circular palisade. It demonstrates a great strength of the cultural tradition, which linked the Corded Ware societies across different regions (within the entire oecumene of the CWC) and at different stages in their development. With this limited number of means, the Corded Ware societies were able to create a great diversity of ritual scenarios, observed on the cemeteries of that culture, either the newly discovered ones or those known from the litera- ture on the subject, which are now being re-interpreted. Most certainly, the examples presented here do not ex- haust this diversity of scenarios.","title":"Kurhan, rów i palisada w tradycji kultury ceramiki sznurowej.

They appeared some 200 years after the demise of the Linear Pottery culture (c. 4800BCE). They have given a new shape to the resurgent 'Danubian Neolithic World'. However, despite intensive research, it is still unclear (1) how the transition process took place after the fall of the LBK; (2) how long rondels were function; and (3) under what circumstances they were abandoned. In this paper, we present a new approach to this problem based on an analysis of the biography of a single object based on the integration of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data. We assume that the high-resolution pollen analysis of lake sediments provides critical data on the dynamics of population change (hiatuses, sharp declines and increases in population size) and how the environment is affected (felling of specific tree species, fires, cultivation of particular crops, grazing intensity). They provide a better understanding of the sequence of settlement and construction changes as well as alterations in material culture available in the archaeological record. The subject of the analysis is a site in the Lower Oder Valley (north-west Poland), at the furthest northern periphery of the 'Danubian World'.","title":"The Neolithic ceremonial centre at Nowe Objezierze (NW Poland) and its biography from the perspective of the palynological record","creators":[{"firstName":"Lech","lastName":"Czerniak","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Pędziszewska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Święta-Musznicka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Goslar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Matuszewska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Niska","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Podlasiński","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wojciech","lastName":"Tylmann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Polen"},{"tag":"Rondell"},{"tag":"Mittelneolithikum"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Botanik"},{"tag":"Palynologie"},{"tag":"Kreisgrabenanlage"},{"tag":"Bandkeramik"},{"tag":"Landschaftsentwicklung"},{"tag":"abandonment"}],"dateAdded":"2023-11-06T08:16:02Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T09:51:36Z","itemID":31523,"notes":[],"citationKey":"CzerniakEtAl2023NeolithicCeremonial"},{"key":"ZIY5PC7V","version":23849,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2024.2306433","volume":"0","issue":"0","pages":"1-21","publicationTitle":"Journal of Field Archaeology","ISSN":"0093-4690","date":"2024","extra":"Publisher: Routledge\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2024.2306433","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2024.2306433","accessDate":"2024-02-28T08:58:24Z","libraryCatalog":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstractNote":"Radiocarbon dating and Bayesian chronology modeling have provided precise dating for the rondel at Nowe Objezierze (northwestern Poland).

A total of 44 radiocarbon dates are now available for the site, and modeling of these (taking into account depositional processes and the results of palynological analysis) has identified plausible scenarios for its construction and use. The rondel was built around 4800 cal b.c. and operated for about three centuries. The cyclical digging and filling of ditches and the sequential establishment of new ones characterized the historical development of the site. The long duration of use of the site served as a base to analyze the potential construction technology and to propose the reconstruction of the appearance of the rondel.","title":"Monumental and Long-Lasting or Temporary and Performative?

An almost undisturbed stone ring and a burial pit from former settlement feature were found in a cultural layer in Brandýs nad Labem – Vrábí. The grave contained two inhumation burials one above the other and buried probably separately in time. The character of graves, their inventories (including botanical and zoological finds) and the later treatment of the human remains show the specific practices of the Early Bronze Age burial rite. Supported by radiocarbon dating, the chronological identification of the unit corresponds to similar finds in Germany and Poland, however, it is in contradiction to the conventional dating of pottery in Bohemia. The final part of the article discusses the issue of burial barrows in the Early Bronze Age in the northern half of Bohemia.","title":"Mohyla únětické kultury z Brandýsa nad Labem jako doklad ojedinělých pohřebních praktik starší doby bronzové.

Hungarian scholars of the past century tended to focus on large, central, usually fortified or defensive settlements such as tells and hillforts. The past decade has seen a shift in research perspectives: while the study of central settlements has lost none of its importance, interest has grown in microregional research and the investigation of settlements with differing functions and layouts. As the variety of Bronze Age settlements became increasingly clear, it was realised that only complex research projects could address broad issues of Bronze Age land use. As a result, Bronze Age settlement studies in Hungary have pursued two directions over the last 25 years, with systematic national and international excavations during this period focusing not only on tells but also on microregions. The aim of the paper is to examine the fortified settlements of an approximately 8oo-year-long period (23oo/22oo– 16oo/15oo BC) in the central part of the Carpathian Basin. There are significant differences in settlement structures and networks among different parts of modern Hungary, e. g. between Transdanubia on the one hand, and the region along the Danube and to the east of it on the other. Middle Bronze Age fortified settlements in the Carpathian Basin, and the settlement networks they were part of, are quite varied. The picture that emerges from this review is one of great variability in terms of settlement forms, locations and relationships between settlements. We need to differentiate between various types of sites in terms of fortification, duration of occupation, position within local and regional settlement hierarchies, etc. In terms of the concentration of specialist activities such as metalworking, we also need to revise the assumption that these were exclusive to central settlements. All these new data can fundamentally transform the history of the Middle Bronze Age in the region and may show that previous socio-economic interpretations need to be reconsidered.","title":"Dividing

The conclusion formed on the evidence emerging from the scarce excavations carried out with traditional archaeological methods has established that groups of Eastern European origin started to appear in the Great Hungarian Plain already in the Copper Age. Archaeology has generally called these communities 'people of the Pit-Grave Culture' (Yamna Culture on its native territory). Science puts the roots of this ethnic group, whose anthropological type and unusual burial rites differ from those of the indigenous cultures of the Great Hungarian Plain, on the vast steppe areas north of the Black Sea. Although the society in question, bearing several differences from the native cultures, was developed far from the Carpathian Basin and migrated here later, it has not become clear to date how these groups, who bury their dead under kurgans, arrived in the region...","title":"Őskori kurgánok a magyar alföldön (Ancient Kurgans in the Great Hungarian Plain)","creators":[{"firstName":"János","lastName":"Dani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tünde","lastName":"Horváth","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Bestattung"},{"tag":"Kupferzeit"},{"tag":"Hügelgrab"},{"tag":"Südosteuropa"},{"tag":"Ungarn"},{"tag":"Katakombengrabkultur"},{"tag":"Grubengrabkultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-11T08:49:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-11T08:49:56Z","itemID":7136,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DaniHorvath2012OskoriKurganok"},{"key":"CMJ9JPVK","version":4220,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"Bayer.

Such centres share numerous common traits, some of which can be recognized through archaeological signatures. But it is only part of the picture. Something of the complexity of ceremonial sites and their usage is explored through two anthropological cases in which ancient sites still used in the modern world provide insights into how structured purposeful journeys might have worked in prehistoric times: the Hajj to Mecca (Saudi Arabia), and journeys to the cathedral of St James in Santiago de Compostela (Spain). Using the perspectives offered by these places, attention then turns to Stonehenge on the chalk downs of central southern England as an archaeological case. The great stone monuments of the third and second millennia BCE did not exist in isolation but were part of a much wider long-lived ceremonial landscape that lay at the intersection of numerous routes and roads that brought materials and people to this significant place. Two key themes relating to the roads to Stonehenge are explored. First, the origins and derivation of the stones used in the construction of Stonehenge: sarsens stones from the Wessex Downs, and so-called ‘Bluestones’ from southwest Wales. Second, is the way the site worked for the people who used it and where they came from.\n\nWege nach Stonehenge: Ein vorgeschichtliches Heilzentrum und Pilgerstätte im südlichen Britannien Das Pilgern zu einschlägigen Kultzentren ist weitverbreitet in heutigen wie in vergangenen Zeiten. Diese Stätten verfügen alle über unzählige bekannte Straßen; einige davon sind durch archäologische Beweise ›sichtbar‹ geworden. Das ist aber nicht alles: Aspekte von Komplexität und Nutzung kultureller Zentren können im Vergleich durch zwei anthropologische Beispiele dargestellt werden, bei denen historische Stätten auch heute weiterhin genutzt und aufgesucht werden. Sie bieten uns Einblicke wie strukturiertes und zielgerichtetes Reisen in frühgeschichtlicher Zeit funktioniert haben könnten: der Haji nach Mekka (Saudi-Arabien) sowie der Camino de Santiago (Spanien). Mit diesen Vergleichen lohnt sich ein erweiterter Blick auf die Kreideebenen um Stonehenge als rein archäologisches Zeugnis (von Reisen) im Süden Englands. Die großen Steinmonumente des 3. Und 2. Jhs. v. Chr. haben nicht isoliert bestanden, sondern waren Teil einer ausgedehnten, längerfristig genutzten zeremoniellen Landschaft, an der sich zahlreiche Straßen und Wege für materiellen sowie personellen Austausch / Kulturtransfer trafen. Zwei Kernpunkte bezüglich der Routen nach Stonehenge werden hier untersucht, zum einen die Herkunft und Verbreitung der Gesteinsarten, die zur Konstruktion von Stonehenge genutzt wurden: die Sarsen-Steine der südenglische Tiefebene (Downs) aus Wessex und die sogenannten Blausteine aus dem südwestlichen Wales. Zum anderen wird der Ort daraufhin untersucht, wie der Ort auf jene Personen wirkte, die diesen besuchten und woher sie stammten.","title":"Roads to Stonehenge: A prehistoric healing centre and pilgrimage site in southern Britain","creators":[{"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Darvill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ranft","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Schenkluhn","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Stonehenge"},{"tag":"Endneolithikum"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Pilgerschaft"},{"tag":"Heiligtum"},{"tag":"Rondell"},{"tag":"Religion"}],"dateAdded":"2017-06-20T09:11:09Z","dateModified":"2021-07-28T10:51:45Z","itemID":30,"notes":[],"citationKey":"Darvill2016RoadsStonehenge","publicationTitle":"Kulturstraßen als Konzept. 20 Jahre Straße der Romani"},{"key":"EGC3QX3Z","version":16546,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/mythical-rings-waun-mawn-and-stonehenge-stage-1/2F089B76AA2411BB09DBAFE79060101F","pages":"1-15","publicationTitle":"Antiquity","ISSN":"0003-598X, 1745-1744","date":"2022/11/04","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2022.82","accessDate":"2022-12-05T15:12:30Z","libraryCatalog":"Cambridge University Press","language":"en","abstractNote":", In a recent Antiquity article, Parker Pearson and colleagues (2021) presented results from excavations at Waun Mawn in south-west Wales, interpreting the site as a dismantled stone circle and source for some of the Bluestone pillars used in the Aubrey Holes at Stonehenge. Here, the author examines the evidence, showing that alternative interpretations are possible. Waun Mawn is argued to represent a series of smaller stone settings, typical of ceremonial sites in south-west Wales. Meanwhile the Aubrey Holes are shown to reflect a well-established regional sequence in which post circles are followed by pit circles. A Welsh ‘source-circle’ for Stonehenge cannot be excluded but, the author argues, the claim is unsupported by the current evidence.","title":"Mythical rings?

The survey is important in providing, for the first time, abundant detail on the form and structure of the Stonehenge Cursus, including the recognition of entrances in both of the long sides. Much additional information about the internal form of round barrows in the Cursus Round Barrow Cemetery, the course of the Avenue, the course of the so-called Gate Ditch, and numerous tracks and early roads crossing the landscape was recorded. A series of previously unrecognized features were identified: a pit-arc or cove below a barrow on the west side of King Barrow Ridge, a square-shaped feature surrounded by pits on the east side of Stonehenge Bottom, and a linear ditch on the same solstical axis, and parallel to, the southern section of the Stonehenge Avenue. An extensive scatter of small metallic anomalies marking the position of camping grounds associated with the Stonehenge Free Festival in the late 1970s and early 1980s raise interesting conservation and management issues.","title":"Stonehenge, Wiltshire, UK: High Resolution Geophysical Surveys in the Surrounding Landscape, 2011","creators":[{"firstName":"Timothy","lastName":"Darvill","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Lüth","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Knut","lastName":"Rassmann","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Fischer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kay","lastName":"Winkelmann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"dateAdded":"2017-06-20T12:17:39Z","dateModified":"2021-07-28T10:51:54Z","itemID":43,"notes":[],"citationKey":"DarvillEtAl2013StonehengeWiltshire"},{"key":"WVT56KE5","version":5493,"itemType":"book","place":"Oxford","date":"2001","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_1534","title":"One Land, Many Landscapes.

En ce qui concerne plus précisément l'étude de l'âge du Bronze, certains de ses outils méthodologiques actuels ont été proposés déjà par Oscar Montelius à la fin du XIXe siècle. Il s'agit notamment de la méthode typologique, largement inspirée de la théorie de l'évolution des espèces de Charles Darwin. Associée à la stratigraphie et couplée au corpus des ensembles clos, elle a fourni un cadre de références sur lequel est bâtie l'évolution chronologique et historique de l'âge du Bronze. Ce noble procédé ne fait cependant plus recette. C'est en effet une méthode exigeante, qui passe par une acquisition longue et astreignante des connaissances. Le développement des méthodes de datation absolue, en particulier le 14C, conduit ainsi certains archéologues à délaisser la typologie, mais ces utilisateurs à tout-va semblent ne pas en mesurer exactement les conséquences.

Therefore, advance of research during the last decades can clearly be realised. New hoards were also discovered in Eastern Bavaria, changing the basis of knowledge as well quantitatively as qualitatively. This shows the strong bias of the archaeological record even 30 years ago, especially in regard of hoards of finished products. Significance is particularly questionable concerning the relation between the number of finds and the long duration of the developed and late phases of the Early Bronze Age (A2a-früh–Bz-B-älter) of roughly half a millennium. The Southern Bavarian hoard-landscape is dominated by depositions of Ringbarren and Spangenbarren during the middle and later Early Bronze Age (A2a-früh–Bz-B-älter). Composition and typology of the objects deriving from the rare hoards of finished products in Eastern Bavaria conform with hoards from the Unetice Culture (Bz A2a) in Bohemia, Southern Moravia and Lower Austria respectively the subsequent cultural groups Mad’arovce-Věteřov-Böheimkirchen (Bz A2b–Bz B-älter).","title":"Bronzedepotfunde der Früh- und Mittelbronzezeit in Ostbayern","creators":[{"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"David","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mittelbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Frühbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Chronologie"},{"tag":"Süddeutschland"},{"tag":"Spätbronzezeit"},{"tag":"Deponierung"},{"tag":"Bayern"},{"tag":"#Projekt_EneoFbzMbz"},{"tag":"Straubinger Kultur"}],"dateAdded":"2021-06-16T08:41:46Z","dateModified":"2023-01-12T20:01:01Z","itemID":11615,"notes":[],"citationKey":"David2015BronzedepotfundeFruh"},{"key":"KC2CXGNR","version":3284,"itemType":"bookSection","series":"Rivista di Scienze Preistoriche","place":"Firenze","publisher":"Instituto Italiano die Preistoria e Protostoria","pages":"##-##","date":"2020","callNumber":"EndNoteRecNr_7488","seriesNumber":"LXX S1","title":"L’Italia settentrionale tra il sud del centro Europa ed il Bacino Carpatico.
