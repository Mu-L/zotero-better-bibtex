            It looks like you did not upload an debug log. The debug log is important; it gives `@retorquere` your current BBT settings and a copy of the items under consideration as a test case so he can best replicate your issue, or build towards the desired behavior. Without it, `@retorquere` is effectively blind. **debug logs are useful for both analysis and for enhancement requests**; in the case of export enhancements, I need the copy of the references you have in mind.

            If you did try to submit a debug log, but the ID looked like `D<number>`, that is a Zotero debug report, which I cannot access. Please re-submit a BBT debug log by one of the methods below.

            **This request is much more likely than not to apply to you too @{{username}}, _even if you think it unlikely_**. Please trust `@retorquere` when he says he will usually need one; he will more often than not just end up saying "please send a debug log". Let's just skip over the unnecesary delay this entails. Sending a debug log is very easy:

            1. If your issue relates to how BBT behaves around a **specific reference(s)**, such as citekey generation or export, select at least one of the items(s) under consideration, right-click it, and submit an BBT debug log from that popup menu. If the problem is with export, please do include a sample of what you see exported, and what you expected to see exported for these references.

            2. If the issue **does not relate to references** and is of a more general nature, generate an debug log by restarting Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproducing your problem, and selecting "Send Better BibTeX debug report..." from the help menu.

            Once done, you will see a debug ID in red. Please post that debug id in the issue here.

            Thank you!
          message.no-close: Thanks for the feedback; there's no way you could have known, but @retorquere prefers to keep bugreports/enhancements open as a reminder to merge the changes into a new release.
